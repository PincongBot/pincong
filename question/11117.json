{"type":"question","id":11117,"title":"各位有没有觉得外网五毛最近明显增多？","uid":14934,"topics":[147,889],"contents":"我经常混 Reddit，一直以来 /r/China 都还挺反动的，但最近感觉五毛明显增多，不光是踩帖子，还专门来用很老套的逻辑混淆是非，我摘录几个例子：<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>I am 1/2 Chinese. Most manilanders care more about the rising price of pork than HongKong problems. People have already prepared for the worst when Hongkong Becomes like Detroit. So what, There are more than 600 cities in China. Hongkong is just nothing important anymore. All of its functions has already been replaced or would be replaced by other cities.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>CCP does represent the majority of Chinese people's will on separatism and other things.<br>\n<br>\nIf you don't want HK and TW to be attacked by PLA tomorrow, I suggest you reconsider about it.<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>What i'm trying to tell you is, i support the protestors, but there's no need to make life difficult for the rest of us. The extradition bill has already been scrapped, and Carrie Lam has even agreed to hold negotiations. I just wish the protestors at least consider talking it out.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n以前我都能得到不少理性讨论，有贴必回。现在完全不行了。<br>\n<br>\n各位有没有在国外其它平台 Twitter，Facebook 等上也发现五毛变多了？中国加大海外宣传了？","date":"2019-11-14","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
