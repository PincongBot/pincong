These devices run Geekbench (and possibly other benchmarks) in an <b>artificial </b>benchmark mode. Other applications do not run in this benchmark mode, which leads to benchmark results that do not correspond to real-world performance.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n在这之前（2018年9月），Geekbench引述了Anandtech关于华为操纵手机性能跑分的情况：<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2018/09/huawei-benchmark-boost/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2018/09/huawei-benchmark-boost/</a><br>\n<br>\nPrimate Labs will exclude the following Huawei phones from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/android-benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Android Benchmark Chart</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Benchmark Chart</a>, and will add an alert to individual results for the following Huawei phones that the phones attempt to <u><b>manipulate</b></u> benchmark results:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><br>\n<li>Huawei P20</li><br>\n<li>Huawei P20 Pro</li><br>\n<li>Huawei Mate 10</li><br>\n<li>Huawei Mate 10 Pro</li><br>\n</ul><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/13318/huawei-benchmark-cheating-headache\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.anandtech.com/show/13318/huawei-benchmark-cheating-headache</a><br>\n<br>\nAs part of our phone comparison analysis, we often employ additional power and performance testing on our&nbsp;benchmarks. While testing out the new phones, the Honor Play had some odd results. Compared to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/12676/the-huawei-p20-p20-pro-review\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Huawei P20 devices tested earlier in the year</a>, which have the same SoC, the results were also quite a bit worse and equally weird.<br>\n<br>\nWithin our P20 review, we had noted that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/12676/the-huawei-p20-p20-pro-review/4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the P20’s performance had regressed compared to the Mate 10</a>. Since we had encountered similar issues on the Mate 10 which were&nbsp;resolved with a firmware update pushed to me, we didn’t dwell too much on the topic and concentrated on other parts of the review.<br>\n<br>\nLooking back at it now after some re-testing, it seems quite blatant as to what Huawei and seemingly&nbsp;Honor had been doing: the newer devices come with a benchmark detection mechanism that <b>enables a much higher power limit for the SoC with far more generous thermal headroom</b>.&nbsp;Ultimately, on certain whitelisted applications, the device performs super high compared to what a user might expect from other similar non-whitelisted titles. This consumes power, pushes the efficiency of the unit down, and reduces battery life.<br>\n<br>\nThis has knock-on effects, such as trust, in how the device works. The end result is a single performance number is higher, which is good for marketing, but is unrealistic to any user with the device. The efficiency of the SoC also decreases (depending on the chip), as the chip is pushed well outside its standard operating window. It makes the SoC, one of the differentiating points of the device, look worse, all for the sake of a high benchmark score. Here's the example of benchmark detection mode on and off on the Honor Play:<br>\n<a href=\"https://telegra.ph/file/521e554925a77bef12fbb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://telegra.ph/file/521e554925a77bef12fbb.png\" alt=\"https://telegra.ph/file/521e554925a77bef12fbb.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a>","date":"2020-01-05","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":1}
