The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n“As we do in all crises, the Community’s experts respond by surging resources and producing critical intelligence on issues vital to U.S. national security. The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nhttps://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2112-intelligence-community-statement-on-origins-of-covid-19","date":"2020-05-02","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":2}
