This result may be reflective of the proposed mechanism of action of zinc sulfate in COVID-19. Zinc has been shown to reduce SARS-CoV RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity in vitro [13]. As such, zinc may have a role in preventing the virus from progressing to severe disease, but once the aberrant production of systemic immune mediators is initiated, known as the cytokine storm, the addition of zinc may no longer be effective [17]. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic synergistic mechanism of zinc sulfate with hydroxychloroquine, if used early on in presentation with COVID-19. However, our findings do not suggest a prophylactic benefit of zinc sulfate in the absence of a zinc ionophore, despite interest in this therapy for prevention. A prophylactic strategy of zinc sulfate should be evaluated to help answer this question.】<br>\n<br>\n<b>大意是氯喹加锌的疗法其实是早期有效的，但需要去ICU的基本无效，毕竟去ICU的主要问题是细胞因子风暴</b>。而之前广传的那个氯喹无效的基本都是重症才给药。<br>\n这两天川普又再次推广这个疗法来着，很多只看主流左媒的人，以为这个也跟他之前说的那个消毒水差不多呢，但这次这个不太一样，是有医学根据的。<br>\n目前主流媒体包括右翼的fox都不看好川普的这个疗法，但他们都普遍忽略了川普还说要补充锌片来着。现在已经看到很多地方认为<b>左媒漠视生命或者deep state只想卖昂贵新药的说法了</b>。<br>\n如果六月的双盲实验结果全出来，他们会不会遇到翻车的情况？舆论会怎么样发展？<br>\n（然后一个医学频道medcram的视频关于这种疗法的分析居然被youtube删了，也不知道怎么回事）<br>\n<br>\n当然氯喹不能乱吃，谨遵医嘱。锌补充剂的话有些食品含锌量挺高的，可以随便多买点吃吃。","date":"2020-05-20","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":9}
