Plans are being crafted to slash this because “we’re not treated right.”<br>\n<br>\n“They gave us a lot of bad advice,” he said of the WHO.<br>\n<br>\nTrump spoke as the WHO held its first annual assembly since the pandemic swept the world after originating in China, causing massive economic disruption and killing 316,000 people — close to a third of them in the United States.<br>\n<br>\nTrump said China only pays about $40 million a year and one idea was for Washington to bring “our 450 down to 40,” but “some people thought that was too much.”<br>\n<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYWJrquU0AARMPz?format=jpg&amp;name=orig\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYWJrquU0AARMPz?format=jpg&amp;name=orig\" alt=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYWJrquU0AARMPz?format=jpg&amp;name=orig\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/GuardianNigeria/status/1262500987023081473<br>\n视频：<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/1262480295623708672<br>\nhttps://www.voachinese.com/a/trump-WHO-2020-05-18/5425765.html?nocache=1","date":"2020-05-19","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
