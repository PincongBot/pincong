In 4th June, the protesters caught some soldiers n beat them to death, one soldiers was even tied up n set on fire, burned alive to death. This was the reason the armored force was sent to clear up the Tiananmen square.&nbsp; This was showed on TV then. But none of the videos on YouTube mentioned it. So the protestors seemed totally innocent, seeking for justice. <br>\n<br>\nAlmost all the Videos about Hong Kong protests just tell what the police have done to the protestors, pepper spray, tear gas. Very few show what the protestors have done to the police, to the community, to the people who don't agree with them. So they seem like fighters for freedom, representative of. Justice. <br>\n<br>\nIt is not objective n unreasonable to say one party is absolutely wrong regardless of whatever the other party has done. <br>\n<br>\nOf course CCP has made mistakes, who can deny that? But can it be the reason for u to deny our country, to abandon ur identity as a Chinese.","date":"2020-01-21","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":1}
