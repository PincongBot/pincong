\"acting as an agent of a foreign government,\" and \"attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China.\"</a><br>\n<br>\nBack to the market: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._market%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Huanan Seafood Market</a>&nbsp;didn’t even have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._no-bats%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bats for sale, and most bats species in Wuhan would be hibernating at the time of outbreak.</a>&nbsp;It was reported that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._market%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">34% of cases had no contact with the market, and ’No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases’.</a><br>\n<br>\nIf an infected animal was indeed the culprit, why did it fail to infect a single person outside of the market? It could not have been infected at the market, because there were no bats that could serve as sources of infection. So,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._outside-wuhan%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">where were all the infected people outside of Wuhan by the time SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in the market?</a><br>\n<br>\nWe hope that this document adequately addressed each claim with what evidence is available and fulfilled its secondary responsibility of educating you on biolaboratory safety. By now, we hope you understand that these claims are not impossible; they are in fact more than likely.<br>\n<br>\nWe may never be certain of the truth. What we are certain of, however, is that these claims shouldn’t be discounted, and far more research must be done to disprove either one.<br>\n<br>\nOur work as a global community must continue.","date":"2020-04-22","agreeCount":10,"discussionCount":2}
