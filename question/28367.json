Taiwan then embarked on a journey to procure new diesel submarines but struggled to complete this mission due to Chinese pressure. [2] In 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush offered Taiwan a foreign military sales package that included an offer for eight diesel-electric submarines. [3] As the United States had not produced diesel-electric submarines since the 1950s, the administration suggested that U.S. shipyards would produce the submarines off European-licensed designs. Fearing Chinese retaliation, European states refused to license production for any U.S. diesel-electric submarines destined for Taiwan.
