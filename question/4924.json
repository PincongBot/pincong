I and my friends received “**congrats**” messages from people in United States and Australia. The reason is that Carrie Lam’s English version is: “suspend indefinitely”. The top definition in urban dictionary (how people commonly understand the word at this age) is “without ending, forever, endless period of time, infinite.” In Chinese, “暫緩” means “slow it down temporarily”. Carrie Lam is playing the translation trick so that the international world will not make so much noise and that the investors won’t go away. And more importantly to save face for Xi Jinping. Please spread this to people outside Hong Kong so that they are aware of this trick.<br>\n<br>\nCredit: Lake Lui</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLink:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/c15s4q/comment/erbj8w2?st=JWZJ1ECG&amp;sh=14523b4a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/c15s4q/comment/erbj8w2?st=JWZJ1ECG&amp;sh=14523b4a</a>","date":"2019-06-16","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
