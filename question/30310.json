Victor)是拒絕他們用這種方式強迫她表態,而出現以上場面.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; 相當佩服她的勇氣與堅定,被一大群失去理智的\"暴民\"包圍住,卻還能堅定自己的立場<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; Several diners at other tables went along, standing or raising their fists, until the crowd homed in on Victor and her companion in front of Los Cuates, a Mexican restaurant.<br>\n<br>\n“I wasn’t actually frightened,” Victor said.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; Victor said she was a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and had marched in previous demonstrations. But Victor said she also felt that it was wrong for hundreds of people to surround a small group of diners, approach them with their hands raised, and try to cow them into making a show of support.<br>\n<br>\n“It just felt overwhelming to have all of those people come at you. To have a crowd — with all that energy — demand that you do this thing. In the moment it didn’t feel right,” Victor said.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n“They like to think because I raise my fist it means something or other.”<br>\n<br>\nAs the crowd moved on, Chuck Modiano continued to yell at Victor.<br>\n<br>\n“Good for you — you stood your ground,” Modiano said, demanding to know if she had seen the video of Blake’s shooting. “We’re not going to change this [expletive] for people like you.”<br>\n<br>\nModiano, who identified himself as a “citizen journalist” who writes for Deadspin, said he wanted to understand her resistance.<br>\n<br>\n值得一提的是,這位也說支持blm並且之前參與過相關遊行<br>\n<br>\n詳細報導:<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/08/25/dc-protesters-blm-diner-confrontation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/08/25/dc-protesters-blm-diner-confrontation/</a>","date":"2020-08-27","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
