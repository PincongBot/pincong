That would really slow down America’s own technological innovations,” she said.<br>\n“It could turn into an anti-China version of a McCarthyite Red Scare.”<br>\n<br>\nWith relations between Beijing and Washington strained over trade disputes and worries about China’s growing technology prowess, numerous Chinese international STEM students in the US have reported delays and other problems in processing their visas since the US government tightened regulations for researchers in sensitive hi-tech fields last year.<br>\nShirk also said any attempt to decouple the world’s two largest economies would be “absolutely disastrous”.<br>\n“It will [lead to] deglobalisation and the United States will try to get countries to choose, and nobody wants to choose,” she said.<br>\n“I don’t believe we’ll necessarily win that fight – many countries won’t necessarily choose us. China is the largest trading partner of more countries in the world than the United States. So I have this apocalyptic vision of what could happen if they really tried to disentangle.”<br>\nChina and the US are locked in a long-running trade battle that has cost billions of dollars in tariffs on both sides. Negotiations for a deal continue, but concerns about how it would be enforced and whether both sides would have the same understanding of any agreement signed are overshadowing the effort.<br>\nChinese Vice-Premier Liu He will lead a delegation to Washington next week, after the two sides wrapped up the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3003787/pleasure-see-you-again-much-work-do-us-china-trade-talks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest round of talks</a>in Beijing on Friday. China’s official Xinhua news agency reported that they “held discussions on the text of the agreement and achieved new progress”.<br>\nOvernight, Trump said negotiations were “going very well”, but added: “It’s going to have to be a great deal. If it’s not a great deal, we can’t do it.”<br>\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow earlier told CNBC that “we are still making great headway” with the talks.<br>\n<br>\nIn a recent report co-written by Shirk for the Asia Society’s Centre on US-China Relations, she and other writers urged the United States to change course and compete smarter with China rather than sever ties.<br>\nShe earlier said that many of Beijing’s recent policies went against the values and interests of the US, in particular those helping its state-owned enterprises in order to pursue its goal of turning China into a hi-tech superpower.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking on Saturday, Shirk said China should make “bold moves” to reform.<br>\n“I think the key is the business community. If China can undertake bold moves, not just in the context of this trade negotiation, even laterally, things that would be good for China’s economy itself – opening up more sectors to foreign investment, the end of [joint venture] requirements – they appear to want to do that,” she said.<br>\n“I think those economic steps – greater opening, more market orientation, SOE reform – basically go back to the third plenum document in 2013, which is really good,” Shirk said, referring to a Communist Party document promising a series of economic reforms. “And [what is required is] just actually act upon it.”","date":"2019-04-02","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
