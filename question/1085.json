Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.&quot;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; -- George Orwell,&nbsp;Nineteen Eighty-Four<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink</a><br>\n【抛砖引玉】<br>\n<ol><br>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aboluowang.com/2011/0915/218557.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">支持本拉登即将留美生：能不回来就不回来了</a></li><br>\n<li>You must fit in/ you must stand out 你要融入集体/你要出类拔萃</li><br>\n<li>Follow your dreams/ find a secure job 追求你的梦想/ 找个稳定的工作</li><br>\n<li>Rags-to-riches/ money can't buy happiness 白手起家/ 金钱买不来幸福</li><br>\n<li>Your life is run by fate/ you must exercise your free will 你的人生被命运主宰/ 你应该行使自由意志</li><br>\n<li>Don't lie/ don't say anything that's rude 别撒谎 /别说任何粗鲁的话</li><br>\n<li>You must work well as a team/ you must be a rugged individual 你们应该团队工作/你们应是坚定的个体</li><br>\n<li>express yourself/ wear what is popular this season表达你自己/传这个季节流行的</li><br>\n<li>don't be a phony/ smile and people will like you 别假惺惺的/ 微笑，这样别人才会喜欢你</li><br>\n<li>act your age/ you're only as old as you think you are 按你的年龄行事 /你觉得自己多大就多大&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><br>\n<li>我们要尊重保护个人隐私 / 我光明正大没有什么怕别人知道的</li><br>\n</ol><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n* 2-10来自<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-Doublethink-in-the-world-today\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Quora</a><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n双重思想是东西方都有，其产生的原因是为了服务权力，因此在时政类。欢迎接龙举更多例子，更欢迎各种深度分析。<br>\n&nbsp;","date":"2019-01-03","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
