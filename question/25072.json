Lee, Louise Jones and Lorand Bodo<br>\nWASHINGTON — A private analysis of cellphone location data purports to show that a high-security Wuhan laboratory studying coronaviruses shut down in October, three sources briefed on the matter told NBC News. U.S. spy agencies are reviewing the document, but intelligence analysts examined and couldn't confirm a similar theory previously, two senior officials say.<br>\n<br>\nThe report — obtained by the London-based NBC News Verification Unit — says there was no cellphone activity in a high-security portion of the Wuhan Institute of Virology from Oct. 7 through Oct. 24, 2019, and that there may have been a \"hazardous event\" sometime between Oct. 6 and Oct. 11.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt offers no direct evidence of a shutdown, or any proof for the theory that the virus emerged accidentally from the lab.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6884792-MACE-E-PAI-COVID-19-ANALYSIS-Redacted.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Click here to read the report (information identifying individuals has been redacted).</b></a><br>\n<br>\nIf there was such a shutdown, which has not been confirmed, it could be seen as evidence of a possibility being examined by U.S. intelligence agencies and alluded to by Trump administration officials, including the president — that the novel coronavirus emerged accidentally from the lab.<br>\n<br>\nBut that is one of several scenarios under consideration by U.S. intelligence agencies. Many scientists are skeptical, arguing that the more likely explanation is that the virus was transmitted to humans through animals in a Wuhan live produce market.

Here's what we know</a><br>\nThe document doesn't cite direct evidence to support that assertion. The analysis seems to account for only a tiny fraction of the cellphones that would be expected in a facility that employs hundreds of people. Dr. Just Vlak, a Dutch virologist who visited a nearby satellite facility of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in late November and met with WIV's head of bio-security, told NBC News that the facility he visited had between 200 and 300 staff.<br>\n<br>\nThe document obtained by NBC News also says that an annual international conference planned for early November in the same lower-security portion of the WIV that Vlak visited appears to have been \"cancelled and never took place.\"&nbsp;The conference&nbsp;actually&nbsp;went forward as planned. A second version of the document viewed by NBC News is annotated to say that the conference did proceed. No other differences between the two versions of the document were observed.<br>\n<br>\nFor that and other reasons, some officials are skeptical of the analysis, which is based on commercially available cellphone location data. One U.S. official who has seen the document said the data \"looks really weak to me and some of the conclusions don't make sense.\"<br>\n<br>\nEarlier, U.S. intelligence agencies received reports based on publicly available cellphone and satellite data suggesting there was a shutdown at the lab, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter say. But after examining overhead imagery and their own data, the spy agencies were unable to confirm any shutdown, and deemed the reports \"inconclusive.\"<br>\n<br>\n[url=https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624][/url]<a href=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/n_hunt_KenD_20200503_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/n_hunt_KenD_20200503_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/n_hunt_KenD_20200503_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/n_hunt_KenD_20200503_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg</a><br>\n[url=https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624][/url]<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Intelligence sources: No smoking gun either way that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab</a><br>\nMAY 4, 202001:45<br>\n<br>\n<center>[url=https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624][/url]</center><br>\n<center>[url=https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Intelligence%20sources:%20No%20smoking%20gun%20either%20way%20that%20the%20virus%20originated%20in%20a%20Wuhan%20lab&amp;via=nbcnews&amp;url=https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624&amp;original_referer=https://www.msnbc.com/kasie-dc/watch/intelligence-sources-no-smoking-gun-either-way-that-the-virus-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab-82971205624][/url]</center><br>\nAnother U.S. official said intelligence agencies may give the data another look in the wake of this new report.
