This year a law was passed making it illegal to criticise Israel. To do so can carry a 20 year jail term, or fine and loss of job. Several high profile academics have lost their already for criticism of Israel. This law was passed at the behest of a foreign&nbsp; power an is a violation of the constitution The constitution Says America must&nbsp; not provide financial support to religious organisations, yet it gives 30 billion dollars of tax payers money to the Zionist state of Israel. You must be naive if think that America is abiding by the constitution.&nbsp; Apart from the constitution America is breaking international law on a daily basis. Why don’t you look these things up yourself??<br>\n相关新闻：<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/broward-county-florida-commission-passes-anti-israel-boycott-resolution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/broward-county-florida-commission-passes-anti-israel-boycott-resolution</a>","date":"2020-08-06","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
