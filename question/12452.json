{"type":"question","id":12452,"title":"為什麼其他因素固定的情況下，無神論者的生育率這麼低？","uid":19469,"topics":[793,2594],"contents":"Eric Kaufmann, PhD at Birbeck College, University of London:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>I argue that 97% of the world's population growth is taking place in the developing world, where 95% of people are religious.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, the secular West and East Asia has very low fertility and a rapidly aging population... In the coming decades, the developed world's demand for workers to pay its pensions and work in its service sector will soar alongside the booming supply of young people in the third world. Ergo, we can expect significant immigration to the secular West which will import religious revival on the back of ethnic change. In addition, those with religious beliefs tend to have higher birth rates than the secular population, with fundamentalists having far larger families. The epicentre of these trends will be in immigration gateway cities like New York (a third white), Amsterdam (half Dutch), Los Angeles (28% white), and London, 45% white British.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<b>anonymousLiu</b>提到過這個問題（https://pincong.rocks/question/12332）。我查了一下還真是這個情況。全世界無神論者的比例在1970年到達歷史高點，之後一直穩步下降。這可能跟生育率有關。","date":"2019-12-03","agreeCount":7,"discussionCount":0}
