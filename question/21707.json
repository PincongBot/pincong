Please take some time to understand the situation before you speak<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241373732913811456<br>\n<br>\nChina has treated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#COVID19</a> as highly pathogenic virus according to the law on prevention &amp; treatment of infectious diseases. As WHO stated, China identified the pathogen in a record short time &amp; shared genetic sequence with the world, which helped others with epidemic response.<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241366351286898690<br>\n<br>\nLying and slander won't make the US great, nor will it make up for the lost time. Facing the global pandemic, the right thing to do is put public health ahead of politics.<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241358579329687552<br>\n<br>\nThe US AID promised to give some medical supplies to China, but was not ready until March 11. Given the fast spreading of the pandemic around the world, we have thanked the US and suggested to give them to those more needed asap.<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241201717133205506<br>\n<br>\nWhy not send a WHO expert group to US to investigate? US CDC estimates this season flu has so far sickened at least 36 million people and killed 22,000. CDC Director admitted some were actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#COVID19</a>. American people need &amp; deserve more detailed, transparent explanation.<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241024085380878337<br>\n<br>\nIn 2015, WHO issued Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, saying that disease names may NOT include geographic locations &amp; should avoid causing offence to any national, regional, or ethnic groups.<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1241024029131071489<br>\n<br>\nUS officials said they offered $100 million to China and other countries. We thank the American people for their kind help. But as a matter of fact, we haven’t received $1 from the US government. By the way, has the US paid its dues to WHO?<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pompeo?src=hashtag_click\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Pompeo</a> said to Fox News \"China has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to leave Wuhan to go to places like Italy that's now suffering so badly\" . Stop lying through your teeth! As WHO experts said, China's efforts averted hundreds of thousands of infection cases.<br>\n<br>\nUS officials say that China demands a few American journalists to leave in its countermeasures because China fears what they write about the pandemic. If so, then what is the US afraid of when it asked 60 Chinese journalists to leave by March 13?<br>\n<br>\nIf the US is truly confident of the supremacy of its political system, why are they so afraid of the Communist Party of China and Chinese media?!<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN<br>\n<br>\n一定要唤起美国民众的觉醒，认清美国现任政府的真面目！<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n华姐姐，您冒着生命危险战斗在敌人心脏，您要保重啊！<br>\n我再也不骂您了。<br>\n上次您吹嘘“意大利民众高唱中国国歌”的假新闻，已经收获了效果，意大利民众反感厌恶CCP。<br>\n谢谢您！<br>\nhttps://twitter.com/DaDa8964/status/1240207997764132864","date":"2020-03-21","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":2}
