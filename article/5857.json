Rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, sponge-tipped bullets, etc. were shot at protesters unprecedentedly and indiscriminately. A girl was shot at the eyes and the police denied responsibility; tear gas canisters were shot directly at protesters, in many residential areas and into metro stations; police beat up subdued protesters. Police have lost control, calling protesters “cockroaches”. They rejected arrested persons’ request to contact family or lawyers. Protesters were beaten up till bones broke. The police are alleged to collide with triads. In many occasions, triad attacked protesters and even ordinary citizens with bamboo sticks, metal rods and even machete. They were not arrested after the offence in most occasions. All these incidents drew international concern. The European Parliament adopted a resolution that “calls for the EU, its Member States and the international community to work towards the imposition of appropriate export control mechanisms to deny China, and in particular Hong Kong, access to technologies used to violate basic rights.” The UN has also raised concern on 13 August over the use of less-lethal weapons by the Hong Kong security personnel “in ways that are prohibited by international norms and standards” that created “a considerable risk of death or serious injury.”<br>\n<b>Petition Request</b><br>\nWe therefore ask the House to add human rights clauses to its FTA with Hong Kong.","date":"2019-10-02","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
