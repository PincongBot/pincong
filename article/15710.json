Under the propaganda of nationalist ideology, they eagerly look forward to the outbreak of the virus in other countries.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the early days of the virus outbreak, the Chinese government encountered an ideological crisis in the face of adverse accusations of epidemic prevention and the tragedy of Wuhan.In this case,only when the virus also erupts in developed democracies can they remove their accusations and shirk their responsibilities.In fact, as the virus broke out in the West, ccp gradually regained public opinion and ideology.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, if the virus outbreak only occurs in China, it will accelerate the global industrial chain's transfer from China.But if there is an outbreak all over the world, it will slow down the pressure of industrial chain transfer.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, the Chinese government has sufficient motivation and reasons to send agents to deliberately spread the virus around the world.Just need to deliberately export asymptomatic infected people to all over the world.Governments around the world should face up to and prevent this possibility.","date":"2020-03-06","agreeCount":17,"discussionCount":0}
