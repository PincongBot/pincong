The ABC asks listeners if the game is prejudiced because white goes first<br>\nBy Levi Parsons For Daily Mail Australia<br>\n12:28 BST 23 Jun 2020 , updated 20:57 BST 23 Jun 2020<br>\n<br>\nA former member of the Australian Chess Federation has blasted the ABC for preparing to hold a debate about whether the game is racist.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nJohn Adams, 38, claims a radio producer from the publicly-funded broadcaster phoned to ask if he would take part in Wednesday's discussion focusing on why the white side always gets to go first under the rules of the strategy game.<br>\n<br>\nAstonished by the request, Mr Adams took to Twitter shortly after to scold the ABC for wasting taxpayer's money on 'irrelevant topics!'<br>\n<br>\n'The ABC have taken the view that chess is RACIST given that white always goes first!' he posted.<br>\n<br>\n'They are seeking comment from a chess official as to whether the rules of chess need to be altered!<br>\n<br>\n'Trust the taxpayer funded national broadcaster to apply ideological Marxist frameworks to anything and everything in Australia!'<br>\n<br>\nIssues regarding racial inequality have been thrust into the spotlight since the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.<br>\n<br>\nThe shocking incident triggered mass protests across the globe and has even sparked calls for statues of historic figures to be torn down if they've been linked to racism.<br>\n<br>\nBut Mr Adams says bringing the game of chess into discussions of structural racism is a bridge too far.<br>\n<br>\n'With all the drama resulting from COVID-19, I am amazed that the ABC is broadcasting on irrelevant topics!' he said.<br>\n<br>\nHundreds of outraged Twitter users also took aim at the public broadcaster for entertaining the idea that the strategy game is racist.<br>\n<br>\n'People want the national broadcaster to focus on bigger issues. People are struggling with the economy, with their health, with the lockdown. They don't want their money wasted on bulls**t,' one person wrote.<br>\n<br>\nAnother said: 'The ABC are perpetuating this cancel culture.'<br>\n<br>\n'The only thing I'm surprised about is this call didn't happen in the USA … It's time to stop giving oxygen to this bulls**t,' others added.<br>\n<br>\nWhile Mr Adams has refused to take part in the debate, Australian chess expert Kevin Bonham is set to discuss the matter on James Valentine's afternoon program on ABC Sydney.<br>\n<br>\n'The funny thing is that at social to even lower club level, having white or black makes zero difference to average results,' he said.<br>\n<br>\n'The advantage starts kicking in around middling club level and becomes stronger at the highest levels.'","date":"2020-06-24","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
