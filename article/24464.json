The sentencing court, moreover,<br>\n<br>\nimplicitly addressed Chhun’s first and third issues—that his<br>\n<br>\nUNITED STATES V. CHHUN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nprosecution was politically motivated and that the delay in<br>\n<br>\nprosecuting him proves he was not a future threat—by<br>\n<br>\nemphasizing the government’s prosecutorial discretion and<br>\n<br>\nthe government’s discretion in interacting with other<br>\n<br>\ncountries. The court also addressed Chhun’s second<br>\n<br>\nissue—that he was the only CFF official prosecuted—by<br>\n<br>\nnoting that he was the leader of the movement. Thus, the<br>\n<br>\nsentencing transcript suggests that the court specifically<br>\n<br>\naddressed Chhun’s concerns, addressed the § 3553(a) factors,<br>\n<br>\nand explained Chhun’s sentence.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, we conclude that the district court did not<br>\n<br>\ncommit plain error in sentencing Chhun to life in prison.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nVII. &nbsp; Chhun’s Sentence&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was&nbsp; &nbsp; Not&nbsp; &nbsp; Substantively<br>\n<br>\nUnreasonable<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nChhun argues that his sentence was substantively<br>\n<br>\nunreasonable because the sentencing court did not adequately<br>\n<br>\nconsider Chhun’s “[n]oble” effort to overthrow a “universally<br>\n<br>\ndespised despot,” it punished him only because his overthrow<br>\n<br>\neffort “fail[ed] to succeed,” and it punished him for the<br>\n<br>\npurpose of “send[ing] a message” to foreign governments.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed<br>\n<br>\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Blinkinsop, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/147349/united-states-v-blinkinsop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">606 F.3d</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/147349/united-states-v-blinkinsop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1110</a>, 1116 (9th Cir. 2010). The review must consider the<br>\n<br>\ntotality of the circumstances, while recognizing that the<br>\n<br>\n“‘sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and<br>\n<br>\njudge their import under § 3553(a) in the individual case.’”<br>\n<br>\nId. (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe find that Chhun’s sentence was not substantively<br>\n<br>\nunreasonable. The sentencing court gave numerous reasons<br>\n<br>\n26 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UNITED STATES V. CHHUN<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nto support Chhun’s sentence and thereby showed that it did<br>\n<br>\nnot abuse its discretion in sentencing Chhun. In addition to<br>\n<br>\nthose reasons discussed supra, in Part VI, the sentencing<br>\n<br>\ncourt also explained that illegal conduct will not be shielded<br>\n<br>\nfrom punishment just because it is “noble.” The court<br>\n<br>\nrejected Chhun’s pleas for leniency because he caused the<br>\n<br>\ndeaths of innocent people. These reasoned justifications for<br>\n<br>\nsentencing Chhun to life in prison show that the sentence was<br>\n<br>\nnot substantively unreasonable. Therefore, we hold that the<br>\n<br>\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Chhun<br>\n<br>\nto life in prison.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nVIII. Conclusion<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFor the above-stated reasons, we AFFIRM Chhun’s<br>\n<br>\nconvictions and sentencing in all respects.”<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCFF 柬埔寨自由战士被美国政府定为恐怖组织。<br>\n<br>\n“联邦检察官办公室发言人姆若泽克说，审判过程的证据显示，大约200名柬埔寨自由战士组织的成员参加了2000年的政变，他们有相当多的武器，包括AK47自动步枪、手榴弹和肩负式火箭发射器，但在几个小时内被柬埔寨政府军的坦克击退。-voa”<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n春（CFF领袖，美国籍，赤柬受害人，被联邦法院判终身监禁不得假释）<br>\n他遥控指挥CFF成员在柬埔寨对洪森政府发动多次武装袭击，飞去泰国建立组织营地。<br>\n<br>\n我大概摘出报道没有提到的，上面上诉书中的几点讲一下：上诉称：“1: 美国政府起诉他是政治动机（柬埔寨政府要求美国行动；2: 所有CFF领袖只有他一人被起诉，说明联邦政府没有把这个事件视为极其严重的事件，只判刑春一人是选择性执法。；3: 在追诉期即满之时起诉，说明联邦政府不视其为“future threat” 未来的威胁。” 并且要求法庭注意到他尝试推翻一个“广为人知恶名昭彰的政府” 以及他尝试推翻洪森政府属于“高尚”的行为。“美国政府只是为了对外国政府释放信息” “恐怖行为…没有损害美国利益。”<br>\n<br>\n以上，望联邦考虑是否量刑过重。<br>\n<br>\n法院维持原判 理由其它点不相干，判决没有“实质不合理的”且 “其行为不能因“高尚”受到保护”。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n我说实话看到这个记录挺失望的，以密谋罪，攻击与美国和平中的国家等起诉的。<br>\n<br>\n“密谋在外国杀人、破坏财物、违反美国的中立法案、发动军事行动打击和美国处于和平状态的国家以及在外国使用大规模杀伤性武器。-voa”<br>\n<br>\n判决法官说他不相信春是一个邪恶的人，但是行为必须付出代价。<br>\n<br>\n春仍然在联邦监狱服刑。<br>\n<br>\n想起我原来发的贴说要参加民兵对在美国的共产党家属，大五毛怎样怎样的，看到这个以后一声叹息。<br>\n<br>\n只怕要是我因为这样进去了连个来探监我的华人“反共人士”都不会有，信不信？在美国的反共先锋民运领袖会速速与恐怖份子划清界限！可悲，可笑！<br>\n<br>\n祝好吧 CFF领袖 春 你是英雄。我会记住你名字的意思：“柬埔寨摩西”。","date":"2020-09-26","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
