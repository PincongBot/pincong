Facing the global pandemic, the right thing to do is put public health ahead of politics. <br>\nChina has treated COVID-19 as highly pathogenic virus according to the law on prevention &amp; treatment of infectious diseases. As WHO stated, China identified the pathogen in a record short time &amp; shared genetic sequence with the world, which helped others with epidemic response. <br>\nYou may not know that Wuhan Health Commission issued a notice on December 31? Please take some time to understand the situation before you speak. <br>\nOn Jan 25 President Trump tweeted to appreciate and thank China's efforts &amp; transparency. The same day US State Dept started to withdraw its consulate in Wuhan. On Feb 2 the travel ban was applied to China. What have you done since then? Scapegoating China doesn't help. <br>\nOn Mar. 13 three leading Chinese experts held a video conference with over 300 US scientists &amp; specialists to share experience on COVID-19. The know how they shared will help save lives in the US. Virus is the REAL enemy! Cooperation is the only right way to win the battle.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/1241824704543023106\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/1241824704543023106</a><br>\n<blockquote>Fmr Fox News Lady: Nonsense.
