The Pentagon has already deemed a threat to national security a few months back.

Are tits a security threat too?<br>\n<br>\nI'm still not seeing the level of proactive engagement from credible western governments that would otherwise lend some authenticity to this claim. Without this kind of support, the anti TikTok movement comes across as biased/racist and as little bit like \"the sky is falling\" fear mongering.<br>\n<br>\nI've signed up for the Zimperium research, looking forward to reading their report (and others like it), and I'll be happy (horrified?!) to change my position and advocate for the removal of TikTok from my loved ones devices.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/blog/tiktok-quickly-settles-child-data-collection-case-still-faces-class-action-alleging-data-sharing-with-china\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.classaction.org/blog/tiktok-quickly-settles-child-data-collection-case-still-faces-class-action-alleging-data-sharing-with-china</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tiktok-illinois-biometric-privacy-lawsuit-20200513-jogjwzp4ofa67nu6pwsduxz7si-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tiktok-illinois-biometric-privacy-lawsuit-20200513-jogjwzp4ofa67nu6pwsduxz7si-story.html</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-class-action-lawsuit-sending-data-china-2019-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-class-action-lawsuit-sending-data-china-2019-12</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-agencies-have-banned-tiktok-app-2020-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-agencies-have-banned-tiktok-app-2020-2</a><br>\n<br>\nFirst three links are settled lawsuits that didn't even get to the discovery phase (two might be the same case) - TikTok just threw money at them to make it go away. The last one is from February this year and outlines which areas of the US government are banning the app and citing the rough reasons as to why. I'm guessing they've had their guys look into the app and made the decision to ban it based on that.<br>\n<br>\nThey might be keeping things quiet for intelligence reasons, like they found a backdoor they can leverage or something. TikTok had quite a few vulnerabilities back when I was actively reversing it, so that could be a reason.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/blog/tiktok-quickly-settles-child-data-collection-case-still-faces-class-action-alleging-data-sharing-with-china\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.classaction.org/blog/tiktok-quickly-settles-child-data-collection-case-still-faces-class-action-alleging-data-sharing-with-china</a><br>\n</blockquote><br>\nFirst lawsuit: COPPA violation, settled.<br>\n<br>\nSecond lawsuit: general claims of data collection without privacy agreement (reasonable suit, but data collected is not different from any other social media app). Claim that app performs \"eager upload\" of videos, after user records a video but before user posts it (reasonable complaint, but not clearly nefarious given that eager upload is a legitimate performance optimization).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tiktok-illinois-biometric-privacy-lawsuit-20200513-jogjwzp4ofa67nu6pwsduxz7si-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tiktok-illinois-biometric-privacy-lawsuit-20200513-jogjwzp4ofa67nu6pwsduxz7si-story.html</a><br>\n</blockquote><br>\nThis is an absolutely absurd lawsuit. They're claiming that because TikTok has face filters, and to use those filters the app has to scan for faces, any use of filters or uploading of video constitutes collection of \"biometric data\". \"We are suing because we don't understand how facial recognition works.\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-class-action-lawsuit-sending-data-china-2019-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-class-action-lawsuit-sending-data-china-2019-12</a><br>\n</blockquote><br>\nSame as earlier, unexpected \"eager upload\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-agencies-have-banned-tiktok-app-2020-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-agencies-have-banned-tiktok-app-2020-2</a><br>\n</blockquote><br>\nVarious government agencies and departments have banned TikTok on phones. Makes sense, given the Chinese government has the ability to use it for intelligence (both direct access to ByteDance's servers, and potentially through insertion of a targeted backdoor). This isn't surprising, though. No government org should run software it doesn't trust, especially in national security contexts. Similarly, the US military probably shouldn't allow Yandex browser, or apps from other Chinese companies. And the Iranian military shouldn't allow the app \"CIA Front Corp presents: Candy Blast 3000\".","date":"2020-08-05","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
