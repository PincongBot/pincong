I think that if the Chinese do crush this what I would call peaceful attempt to maintain their rights, it requires, it seems to me, America, which is known internationally for standing up for human rights, to speak up and to <b>take more forceful action</b>. That’s what I would recommend to the President. Obviously, that’s his decision in the end.<br>\n参议员：嗯，在我看来，我认为这需要我们做出<b>重大回应</b>。我认为，如果中共真的碾碎了香港人的和平维护自己权利的尝试，那么在我看来，这将要求美国——这个在国际上为了维护人权而闻名的国度——站出来并采取<b>更有力的行动</b>。这就是我向总统建议的内容。显然，这是他最终的决定。<br>\n<br>\nHH: There are 450,000 PRC students in the United States. Would part of that<b> forceful action</b> include the expulsion of many, if not all, of them?<br>\n主持人：美国有450,000名中国学生。你提到的那部分<b>强有力的行动</b>是否包括驱逐许多（如果不是全部）的中国学生？<br>\n<br>\nMM: <b>I would look at all the options</b>. You know, we have 75,000 Americans who live and work in Hong Kong as well. That’s truly an international city that has enjoyed a Western-style freedom for a very long time. I think the Chinese are playing with fire here, and hopefully they will not go too far.<br>\n参议员：<b>我会考虑所有的选项</b>。你知道，我们有75,000名美国人在香港生活和工作。这是一个真正的国际城市，在很长一段时间内享有西方式的自由。我认为中国人在这里玩火，希望他们不会走得太远。</blockquote>","date":"2019-09-07","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
