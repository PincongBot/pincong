This bipartisan legislation would provide those Hong Kongers who peacefully protested Beijing’s corrupt justice system, and have a well-founded fear of persecution, to be eligible for Priority 2 Refugee status. The bill is also in response to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) actions to implement its Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Many Hong Kongers are already currently living outside the territory for fear of arrest and repression following their participation in last year’s pro-democracy protests.","date":"2020-06-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
