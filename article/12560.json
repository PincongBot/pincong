After running tests, Facebook found that multiple Burmese words starting with “xi” and “shi” translated to the vulgarity in English.<br>\n<br>\nU Po Myint, the chairman of the China Myanmar Friendship Association, said he thought that Facebook may have intentionally mistranslated Mr. Xi’s name because there are other more likely renderings of his given name in Burmese.<br>\n<br>\n“But Facebook already apologized for their mistake so we can forgive,” Mr. Po Myint said.<br>\n<br>\nKenneth Wong, a Burmese language instructor at the University of California in Berkeley, Calif., also said that when he first saw the translation he thought someone intentionally made it to embarrass Mr. Xi.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nContinue reading the main story<br>\nBut on closer inspection of the original Burmese post, Mr. Wong said, he could see how a machine would make that error. Mr. Xi’s name sounds similar to “chi kyin phyin,” which roughly translates to “feces hole buttocks” in Burmese, Mr. Wong said.<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote>","date":"2020-01-20","agreeCount":18,"discussionCount":0}
