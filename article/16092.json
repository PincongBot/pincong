our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.</pre><br>\n大家好，我针对<b><u>中共给全世界带来的这个灾难</u></b>讲两句<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<pre>Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.<br>\n<br>\nWe have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.&nbsp;I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.<br>\n<br>\nFrom the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats.&nbsp;This is the way it always was and always will be.&nbsp;It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.<br>\n<br>\nOur team is the best anywhere in the world.&nbsp;At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years.&nbsp;We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.<br>\n<br>\nAnd taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe.<br>\n<br>\nThe European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots.As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.<br>\n<br>\nAfter consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans.<br>\n<br>\nTo keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.&nbsp;The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.&nbsp;These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.<br>\n<br>\nThere will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.&nbsp;These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.</pre><br>\n那些听信CHO的人们已经受到了惩罚，我才不管他们和中国外交部怎么说，现在的情况就是美国比欧洲好，尤其是和某些亲华国家相比。你们喜欢一带一路和命运共同体，那就去die吧。欧洲人也别来了，对了，脱欧的英国不算，我们只是不欢迎鼓吹全球化的那些SB。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<pre>At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea.&nbsp;And, as their situation improves, we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.<br>\n<br>\nEarlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.<br>\n<br>\nWe are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time.&nbsp;These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help C.D.C. and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies.&nbsp;Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day.&nbsp;We are moving very quickly.<br>\n<br>\nThe vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low.&nbsp;Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus.&nbsp;The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions.&nbsp;The elderly population must be very, very careful.</pre><br>\n我们会在监控中国的同时，拿出更多钱来帮助相关机构，而不是募捐，更不是援外，即使我们远远没有某些国家那么危险。民主的决策很复杂？它也许不是最快的，但一定是最明智的，而且我们会特事特办，把风险降到最低。对了，这个病毒对老年人威胁很大，年轻人还好。不过我听说有人认为是病毒战？谁的病毒战会打击老年人呢？我不知道，反正美国不会面对即将进入老龄化的压力，也不需要掩盖经济崩溃和失业大潮。<br>\n<br>\n<pre>In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits.&nbsp;In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.<br>\n<br>\nMy administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings.<br>\n<br>\nSmart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nEvery community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts — and they are the best.</pre><br>\n我们将迅速反应，立即行动，马上投入备战，不以任何借口拖延、迟疑，或封锁信息。我们有最好的自下而上的社区系统，而不是最好的皇帝。<br>\n<br>\n<pre>For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene.&nbsp;Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus.&nbsp;Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.<br>\n<br>\nTo ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief.&nbsp;This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.<br>\n<br>\nI will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.<br>\n<br>\nBecause of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.<br>\n<br>\nOur banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong.&nbsp;Our unemployment is at a historic low.&nbsp;This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.<br>\n<br>\nThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions:&nbsp;I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.<br>\n<br>\nEffective immediately, the S.B.A. will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories.&nbsp;These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus.To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion.<br>\n<br>\nUsing emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.&nbsp;This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.&nbsp;Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.<br>\n</pre><br>\n我们会要求一些基本的防护措施，但不会要求戴口罩然后去抓人，不会去审查和登记，也不会封村堵路，更不会为了经济强制复工，我们的经济非常好，失业率非常低。金融危机？又不是第一次了，我们不还是厉害的国。不光如此，我还要给企业和个人补贴，政府从人民那里获取的税收就是这么用的，而且我还要降税，共克时艰。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<pre>We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.&nbsp;We made a lifesaving move with early action on China.Now we must take the same action with Europe.&nbsp;We will not delay.&nbsp;I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people.&nbsp;I will always put the well being of America first.<br>\n<br>\nIf we are vigilant — and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will — we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.&nbsp;The virus will not have a chance against us.<br>\n<br>\nNo nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.&nbsp;We have the best economy, the most advanced health care, and the most talented doctors, scientists and researchers anywhere in the world.<br>\n<br>\nWe are all in this together.&nbsp;We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family.<br>\n<br>\nAs history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.<br>\n<br>\nOur future remains brighter than anyone can imagine.&nbsp;Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.<br>\n<br>\nGod bless you, and God bless America.&nbsp;Thank you.</pre><br>\n我们从中国救援美国公民，也会从欧洲救援美国公民，他们的背后是伟大的美利坚合众国，每个人都会因为自己是美国人而自豪。我们的未来也会更好，上帝保佑我们，我们是有信仰的美国人，我们不是无神论的共产主义者，我们的前途很光明。谢谢大家","date":"2020-03-12","agreeCount":14,"discussionCount":0}
