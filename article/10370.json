But Hong Kong protester May's nuptials are on hold because her friends oppose her marrying a policeman.<br>\n<br>\nSix months of unprecedented protests in Hong Kong against eroding freedoms under Chinese rule have divided the city's population.<br>\n<br>\nRifts in some cases have pitted relatives, friends and even lovers against each other.<br>\n<br>\nMay, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym, is one of those who has seen the political become deeply personal, threatening to torpedo her February wedding.<br>\n<br>\n\"One of my closest friends -- my maid of honour -- told me that she's thinking about not attending my wedding,\" May told AFP.<br>\n<br>\n\"I never thought about losing my friends... It makes me very, very sad,\" the 28-year-old said.<br>\n<br>\n\"It has made me realise how fractured the relationship between the police and residents has become.\"<br>\n<br>\nHong Kong's police were once hailed as an example for other Asia forces, but they have become a target of intense hatred to many pro-democracy protesters who accuse them of excessive force.<br>\n<br>\nSince protests began, police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, along with rubber bullets and pepper spray.<br>\n<br>\nViral images on social media of police hitting protesters with batons have fuelled the anger.<br>\n<br>\nPolice have also occasionally used live bullets, with three people shot during clashes. None of the shootings resulted in deaths, but two of those shot suffered serious injuries.<br>\n<br>\nProtesters have called for an independent probe into alleged police abuses, making it a key plank in their \"five demands.\"<br>\n<br>\nPolice chiefs have insisted their officers have responded with restraint to violence from protesters throwing molotov cocktails, bricks and other objects.<br>\n<br>\n- Different values -<br>\n<br>\nMay has been with her fiance for eight years, but says it wasn't until recently that his career become a bone of contention.<br>\n<br>\nFriends have distanced themselves, and there have been tense moments when jokes about protesters and police have fallen flat.<br>\n<br>\nBut she was still shocked when her best friend confronted her about the relationship after the pair went wedding dress shopping.<br>\n<br>\n\"She said: 'You're not married yet, you still have the choice',\" May recounted.<br>\n<br>\n\"If he's seen this (misconduct) by the police and still thinks they have done nothing wrong, should you be with a person whose values are so different?\" her friend asked.<br>\n<br>\nMay, who has regularly attended rallies as a peaceful protester, has seen violence firsthand.<br>\n<br>\nBut she doesn't believe that her future husband -- a frontline riot officer -- would hurt anyone.<br>\n<br>\n\"I trust his personal conduct, that he wouldn't be the one hitting his baton over protesters' heads and injuring them,\" May said.<br>\n<br>\nShe acknowledges though that it has become increasingly difficult to keep the political crisis from spilling into her relationship.<br>\n<br>\nWhile she describes her fiance as apolitical and uninterested in her involvement in the protests, his friends have criticised her politics, even calling her \"crazy.\"<br>\n<br>\n- 'Quit, or I leave' -<br>\n<br>\nEven before her friends voiced their opposition, May's planning ran into trouble: the printer she chose to do the invitations was among wedding vendors in the city boycotting all celebrations involving police.<br>\n<br>\n\"While the police are making arbitrary arrests and abusing their power against Hong Kong residents, we will not be sending happy wishes to their weddings,\" the vendors said in a November 8 announcement of the boycott.<br>\n<br>\nPolice weddings have also been targeted by protesters, with tear gas and rubber bullets being fired at crowds trying to disrupt the celebrations.<br>\n<br>\nThe tensions in the city and the responses of her friends have left May feeling despondent.<br>\n<br>\n\"It makes me feel that my wedding won't be blessed, just because my partner is a policeman,\" May said.<br>\n<br>\n\"I'm going through a down time emotionally. When he sees me crying, he holds me and tells me not to think about it too much.\"<br>\n<br>\nWith the pressure building, May says she delivered her fiance an ultimatum several weeks ago: \"Either you quit, or I leave.\"<br>\n<br>\nBut she admits a career change would be difficult for him, and she hasn't left him yet, though the wedding is on hold and may yet be cancelled.<br>\n<br>\n\"I think our relationship will continue,\" she said quietly.<br>\n<br>\n\"I can't say for sure, but I'm inclined to stay,\" she added, pausing to take a deep breath.<br>\n<br>\n\"We still love each other deeply.\"","date":"2019-12-05","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
