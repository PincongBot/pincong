The PLA defector believes that Chinese intelligence has penetrated the U.S. government and is therefore wary of cooperating with the CIA and other Western spy agencies.<br>\n<br>\nStill, the defector has provided some information about China’s biological arms program that has reached the U.S. government. No other details of the defection could be learned.","date":"2020-09-18","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
