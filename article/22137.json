It's my great hornor.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, we are happy to&nbsp;enjoy (当时的活动) here. This is a very good activity for all of us. But think about last year, we couldn't. It&nbsp;was not because we didn't want to, but because we couldn't.&nbsp;We just could not.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who took away the happiness we should have enjoyed? It's CCP. Chinese communist party. Not because of the Covid-19 itself, it was CCP. They made the Virus in lab.(如果没有证实，这句话就不说。) They knew&nbsp;this virus can spread from person to person, they hided it and let&nbsp;the virus spread to all over the world. This caused ****(确诊人数) people infected and ****(死亡人数) people died. In Canada, it was&nbsp;****(确诊人数) people infected and ****(死亡人数) people died.&nbsp;****(确诊人数)&nbsp; and ****(死亡人数).(再强调一遍)<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These people might be a number in the news, but if it hitted on a family, it&nbsp;could&nbsp;change their fate forever. Who should be responsible for this?&nbsp;It's CCP. CCP&nbsp;and its accomplices. Not the Chinese people, they were just victims.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I lived in China more than 30 years and suffered all these years. I&nbsp;fled from China mainland and came to Canada to pursue democracy and freedom. I not only gained democracy and freedom, but also respect&nbsp;in Canada&nbsp;and I love this great country. But CCP is destroying these&nbsp;greatness that Canadians are proud of.&nbsp;New CCP&nbsp;Virus has penetrated into our lives.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New CCP Virus&nbsp;stole our intellectual property&nbsp;causing unemployment.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New CCP Virus&nbsp;used technology to steal our privacy.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New CCP Virus&nbsp;import corruption into&nbsp;our country with dirty money.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too many! Too many! And that's enough! They have&nbsp;done&nbsp;so many sins to Canada and Canadian that I can't finish talking in a day. This must be stopped right here and right now.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCP is against whole world. They are&nbsp;Fascist Nazis. They are even worse than&nbsp;Fascist Nazis. That's the reason I still wear a mask right now. I&nbsp;am afraid of being recognized and if so they will persecut my family and friends in China mainland.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe in God while God didn't help us to destroy CCP. But I believe everybody here could be a God on this&nbsp;mission. You could be a God, you could be a God.(用手指向几个随机的人) You can use your power to protect the&nbsp;future of Canada. You can protect the future for your kids and your grand-kids.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell your family and friends how evil CCP is. How many people they have killed. How many families have been destroyed by them. Let everyone realize the evil nature of communism.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More importanly, Go to vote, vote for those parliamentary who are tough to CCP. Force&nbsp;them formulate policies to sanction the CCP,&nbsp;completely separate&nbsp;from China&nbsp;ruled by CCP, repatriate CCP and its families and eliminate all CCP penetration in Canada.<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;The glory belongs to Canada, and it belongs to you.","date":"2020-07-27","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
