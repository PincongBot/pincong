Those are risks the U.S. refuses to accept and have resulted in the revocation of Hong Kong’s special status.<br>\n<br>\nCommerce Department regulations affording preferential treatment to Hong Kong over China, including the availability of export license exceptions, are suspended. Further actions to eliminate differential treatment are also being evaluated. We urge Beijing to immediately reverse course and fulfill the promises it has made to the people of Hong Kong and the world.","date":"2020-06-29","agreeCount":16,"discussionCount":0}
