It may yet become one,\" he said.<br>\n<br>\n<b>\"WHO's risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally.\"</b><br>\n<br>\nWHO said the categorisation was \"a global evaluation of risk, covering severity, spread and capacity to cope\".<br>\n<br>\nThe agency added that the mistake made in three of its situation reports had been an \"error in the wording\".<br>\n<br>\nAsked about the correction, Antoine Flahault, co-director of the Swiss School of Public Health, told AFP: \"It's a mistake. It's definitely a sizeable one... but I really think it's a mistake that has now been corrected\".<br>\n<br>\n<b>Cautious approach</b><br>\n<br>\nWHO's cautious approach to the outbreak, which has been challenged by some critics, can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.<br>\n<br>\nDuring that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought.<br>\n<br>\nBut in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three West Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016.","date":"2020-01-28","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
