One article is titled \"Free Hong Kong,\" a HK secessionist slogan.<br>\n<br>\nAnother post at the top of the website's homepage claimed that this was a \"God-given chance\" for people to unite and fight against the \"common enemy\" as \"the people have never had such low trust in the government\" brought about by \"domestic turmoil and foreign aggression - the trade friction, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the situation in Hong Kong and Taiwan and the sharp economy gliding.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe same post asked, \"Is Doctor Li a hero? Judging from Hong Kong standards, he certainly isn't; seeing things from a universal value, he hardly is one.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe post also mentions \"action strategies,\" including spreading anti-government rhetoric as much as possible, and creating related trendy hashtags on social media platforms like Weibo, Douban and WeChat. Netizens were directed to major news platforms to post comments and lead discussions, provide online support to those with similar opinions, and hype anti-government comments and topics.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n“《环球时报》在美国的品葱网站上发现了许多有关如何组织反政府宣传的在线帖子。香港分裂主义的口号是一篇名为“自由香港”的文章。网站首页顶部的另一篇文章称，这是人们团结和对抗“共同敌人”的“天赐良机”，因为“人民从未对政府如此低信”。国内动荡和外国侵略-贸易摩擦，新型冠状病毒的爆发，香港和台湾的局势以及急剧的经济下滑。”同一条帖子中问道：“李医生是英雄吗？从香港的标准来看，他当然不是；从普遍价值看事情，他简直不是英雄。”该帖子还提到了“行动策略”，包括尽可能多地散布反政府言论，并在微博，豆瓣和微信等社交媒体平台上创建相关的时尚主题标签。网民被引导到主要新闻平台发表评论和引导讨论，向持类似观点的人提供在线支持，并大肆宣传反政府评论和话题。”<br>\n<br>\n看来是置顶帖被视奸了。","date":"2020-02-11","agreeCount":129,"discussionCount":0}
