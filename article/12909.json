The planes will then return to Kalibo without passengers. That's despite the transport clampdown in Wuhan, where the new virus called 2019-nCoV originated.<br>\n<br>\nPan Pacific operates charter flights on the Wuhan-Kalibo route Tuesdays to Sundays while Royal Air on Mondays to Saturdays. Those flights have since been suspended except for the three “ferry flights” to bring home the nearly 500 tourists from Kalibo.<br>\n<br>\nThree cities in central China, including Wuhan, the city of 11 million people, are under lockdown, as Chinese authorities race to contain a deadly virus that has reached parts Asia and the United States. CNN reported that at least 26 people have died and 830 others infected in China as of Friday.<br>\n<br>\nArcilla said the airlines have the clearance to repatriate the foreigners because they are Wuhan residents.<br>\n<br>\nWyrlou Samodio, CAB's chief legal officer, said the tourists' return to China were based on the decision of the two charter companies, who coordinated with Wuhan authorities, and the Philippine aviation board's directive to suspend flights to and from that Chinese city.<br>\n<br>\nHe said some of the tourists were already due to return home, while others had to cut short or could not extend their trips because of the suspension of flights to Wuhan.<br>\n<br>\nAmong them are the 135 foreigners who flew in Thursday, hours before Philippine authorities announced that as a precautionary measure, it will suspend flights to and from Wuhan, Aklan Provincial Health Officer Cornelio Cuachon said Friday.<br>\n<br>\nNone of them was quarantined and referred for hospital care as they did not show the red flag symptoms of the 2019-nCoV such as fever. <br>\n<br>\nBut Arcilla said that strict health screenings in airports across the country since January 5 are not a &quot;guarantee&quot; that the new coronavirus will not enter the country.<br>\n<br>\nHe added the incubation period of the new respiratory virus, which is still undetermined, needs to be considered. After that period, the infected person usually would have fever, cough and colds, breathing difficulties, shortness of breath.<br>\n<br>\nArcilla said international passengers, especially those from China, were advised to see a doctor in case they feel they got the flu or another respiratory disease.<br>\n<br>\nTravel ban sought<br>\nSenator Risa Hontiveros said Philippine authorities should consider a month-long travel ban for any person who &quot;came from or have passed through&quot; Wuhan to prevent the spread of the deadly disease into the country.<br>\n<br>\n&quot;In addition, authorities must place residents of Wuhan presently in the country and those with flu-like symptoms who have traveled through China in the past 14 days under health surveillance,&quot; she said in a statement.<br>\n<br>\nThe measure is an extra precaution on top of the Philippine government's decision to suspend all flights coming from the Chinese city where the disease originated.<br>\n<br>\nA 5-year-old boy who flew from Wuhan to Kalibo, Aklan tested positive for an unidentified coronavirus earlier this week, but eventually tested negative in a subsequent test done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. His samples have been sent to a laboratory in Australia for tests to confirm if he has 2019-nCov.<br>\n<br>\n'No public health emergency yet'<br>\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization declared that the Wuhan coronavirus, which has sparked widespread fears of a deadly pandemic, is not yet a public health emergency of international concern. <br>\n<br>\nWHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as &quot;an extraordinary event&quot; constituting a &quot;public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases such as such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to the World Health Organization. They can be transmitted between animal and human or from infected human to another human, WHO said.","date":"2020-01-25","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
