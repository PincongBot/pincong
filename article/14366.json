They published a few videos on WeChat, a popular messaging app among Chinese people, showing what was really happening in Wuhan under the current coronavirus epidemic. Their audience and family members have lost contact with them for a couple of days now. XU Xiaodong, a famous MMA fighter of China stated in a YouTube video that they are under the custody of local authorities with the excuse of “quarantine”.
