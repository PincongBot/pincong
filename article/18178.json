In these times, being online is critical and many people face ongoing obstacles to getting and sharing needed information. We are taking today’s difficult steps to ensure the Tor Project continues to exist and our technology stays available.<br>\n<br>\nWe are terribly sad to lose such valuable teammates, and we want to let all our users and supporters know that Tor will continue to provide privacy, security, and censorship circumvention services to anyone who needs them.<br>\n<br>\n对于像Tor这样长期以捐助为主要经济来源的非营利组织，疫情肯定会带来不小的打击。过去两个月捐款的人数有所下降，他们只能付出裁员的惨痛代价。<br>\n若有能力，请考虑捐助。","date":"2020-04-26","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
