Videos suggest police lies and likely police brutality in relation to the student's death. With details yet to be confirmed, this HKUST student didn't die in an accident but in the hands of Beijing's puppets. I see a a state murder to be revenged and a war to be fought. And Carrie Lam's regime, murdering and warring against Hongkongers, should cease to exist. <br>\n<br>\n就算按照警方的说法，如果没有催泪弹，香港科大学生周梓乐就不会走得这么早。而且视频表明：警方在说谎，他很可能遭遇了警察的暴力，不一定是在躲避催泪弹时坠楼。无论如何，他死于效忠占领者的傀儡政权之手——这个政权谋杀港人，对港人宣战，它没有理由继续存在。","date":"2019-11-08","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
