How do you feel about that? are you going to continue using that phrase?<br>\n记者： 中国（政府）和其他人对你使用“中国病毒”这个词有所批评。你对此有何感想？你准备继续使用这个词么？<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nTrump:&nbsp; Well, China was puting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them, that was false. and rather than having an argument,<b>&nbsp;I said I have to call it where it came from.</b>&nbsp;It did come from China. So I think it's a very accurate term. But no, I didn't appraciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody.&nbsp;<br>\n特朗普：这个，中国（政府）之前放出消息（假的消息）说我们的军队把这个病毒带给了他们，这是假的。与其与之争论，<b>我决定我要由它的发源地来叫这个病毒</b>。这个病毒是从中国来的，所以我认为“中国病毒”是一个对其非常准确的名字。我对中国（政府）说是我们的军队把病毒带给他们非常不满，我们的军队没有带给任何人病毒。<br>\n<br>\nReporter: Critics say that using that phrase creats a stigma.&nbsp;<br>\n记者：批评者认为使用这个词会对（华裔）造成羞辱。<br>\n<br>\nTrump: No I don't think so. I think saying that out military gave it to them creates a stigma.<br>\n特朗普：不，我不这么认为。我认为说我们的军队把病毒带给了他们才是制造羞辱。<br>\n<br>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\n如上所述，特朗普使用“Chinese Virus”里的“Chinese”可以肯定地说是地域上（geographical）的意思。没有针对种族的意思。所以各位说种族歧视的可以暂停了。<br>\n&nbsp;","date":"2020-03-20","agreeCount":10,"discussionCount":0}
