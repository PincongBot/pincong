Terrible police brutality with abuse of power, force and weapons together with arbitrary or unlawful search, arrest and intrusion into citizens’ home are taken place every day in HK. Their savage acts conform to UN’s definition of terrorism which refers to ‘‘acts of violence that target civilians in the pursuit of political aims or to intimidate a population, including unlawfully and intentionally causing, attempting or threatening to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or noncombatants''. HKPF should be designated as terrorist organization.","date":"2020-05-15","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
