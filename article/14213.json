Texts like ' Die Chinese' , English for 'Chinese, die' and ' Chinese corona' are written in an elevator of the complex. The elevator is also smeared with faeces.<br>\n<br>\n\"This is more than discrimination and xenophobia. The person who does these kinds of terrible things lives with us but tries to destroy the lives of all tenants,\" one of the residents writes on Facebook. According to the resident, many Chinese students live in the building.<br>\n<br>\nA Chinese flag has also been torn from a room door and doors have been thumped on apartment doors. It is still unclear who is behind it. The police are aware of the destruction. \"My colleagues visited this morning to investigate the matter,\" says a spokesperson. \"In the meantime, everything has been cleaned up.\" No one has reported yet. The police are calling on people to do that.","date":"2020-02-10","agreeCount":20,"discussionCount":0}
