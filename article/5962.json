But Hongkongers were justified in doing so because the law refuses to punish this terrorist leader for the part he played in Yuen Long &amp; other attacks but persecutes the victims. Hongkongers have the right to defend themselves &amp; their kids from Ho Kwan Yiu &amp; other terrorists. With terrorist bullets ceaselessly penetrating eyes &amp; chests, such civil counter-terrorism efforts will always be justified until the law returns with protection &amp; justice.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGCIx7TUcAAmI2T?format=png&amp;name=900x900\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGCIx7TUcAAmI2T?format=png&amp;name=900x900\" alt=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGCIx7TUcAAmI2T?format=png&amp;name=900x900\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a>","date":"2019-10-04","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
