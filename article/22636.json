The excuse given has been they are not meeting with any foreign groups.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSince when did a Webex with Cardinal Zen or Martin Lee, a meeting with Nathan Law or Denise Ho, or even a call with Hong Kong democrats equate to hot tubbing with Putin? This rejection by the Biden team is a crude language the CCP fully understands.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<i>https://hk.appledaily.com/local/20200806/YSHNLU5ZKFCPRXYBAEYKK3YBHU/</i>","date":"2020-08-07","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
