Another traffic police intentionally drove motorcycle into the protestors on the same day. These had clearly violated the police guideline. However, none of these police are being prosecuted.<br>\nBased on the above evidence, Tang Ping-keung is clearly favoring the police who should be prosecuted, and this seriously erodes the rule of law in Hong Kong. We demand the U.S. Government to sanction on Tang Ping-keung based on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, revokes citizenship and freeze assets of Tang Ping-keung anywhere outside China.","date":"2020-04-17","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
