The book explains debates over soft power within China and delves into case studies of important policy areas for China’s global image campaign, such as film, news media and the Confucius Institutes. The most comprehensive work of its kind, the volume presents a picture of a Chinese leadership that has access to vast material resources and growing global influence but often struggles to convert these resources into genuine international affection.<br>\n<br>\nWith a foreword by Joseph Nye,&nbsp;<i>Soft Power With Chinese Characteristics&nbsp;</i>will be invaluable to students and scholars of Chinese politics and Chinese media, as well as international relations and world politics more generally.","date":"2020-08-17","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
