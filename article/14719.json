Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.</blockquote><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html</a>","date":"2020-02-17","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
