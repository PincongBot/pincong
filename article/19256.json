Overseas Chinese are really disappointed this time.”</blockquote><br>\n一向爱看战狼2的小郭终于明白过来大家为什么不爱ccp了。<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>Guo, the student in Melbourne, once joined rallies with other mainland Chinese students in Australia to express their discontent with the Hong Kong protests that gripped the city in 2019.<br>\n<br>\nShe said she wanted to convince others that China was not as bad a country as the “Hong Kong separatists” had portrayed.<br>\n<br>\nBut being denied a flight home has changed her perception of the Chinese government completely.<br>\n<br>\nGuo said her friends from other Asian countries had traveled home smoothly. The flight tickets to Hong Kong, only some 80 miles away from her hometown, are much cheaper than flights to the mainland. (Hong Kong has suspended transit services to mainland China.)<br>\n<br>\n“Now I feel it’s so great to be a Hongkonger,” she said. “I will not speak up for my country again. We have been selectively abandoned.”</blockquote><br>\n小郭，曾参加海外反香港游行的游行。不仅完全改变了对土共的想法，哭着说再也不支持了啦，现在还希望成为一个香港人。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>“I’m just waiting for the Chinese government to allow us to return,” Xu said, adding he had been staying at home due to the recent surge in coronavirus infections in Chile. “Even jail has a time frame. This is more painful than jail.”</blockquote><br>\n小徐说坐牢都比这好受。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n依我看，习犬犬每天勤于练习，加速功力深厚，大家不用太担心，躺平即可。","date":"2020-05-24","agreeCount":22,"discussionCount":0}
