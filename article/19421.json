These claims from this point on will be referred to as&nbsp;Claim 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;Claim 2.<br>\n<br>\nThis document does not attempt to provide a concrete conclusion on whether either claim is factually true. Rather, it examines the probability that each claim is true to allow the reader to make his or her own conclusions. While either claim cannot be irrevocably proven true, an attempt has been made to ensure the evidence used to support these claims is as factual as possible.<br>\n<br>\nIf you would like to see a summarized version of every claim (\"TL;DR\") in this document, please see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._the-end%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conclusion</a>.","date":"2020-05-26","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
