Sanyam Jain discovers the exposed ElasticSearch cluster.<br>\nJuly 2 - Researcher contacts the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department and CNCERT/CC.<br>\nJuly 4 - BleepingComputer also reaches out to CNCERT/CC.<br>\nJuly 5 - CNCERT/CC responds saying that the owner has been contacted.<br>\nJuly 8 - Database no longer reachable.<br>\n<br>\nElasticSearch clusters left out in the open<br>\nJain previously found a publicly accessible and leaky ElasticSearch cluster owned by Chinese headhunting company FMC Consulting that exposed the resumes of millions of customers, company records, as well as employee and customer PII data.<br>\n<br>\nHe also unearthed how more than 12,000 unsecured MongoDB databases were wiped over a three week time period, with the only a message being left behind by the attackers who asked the databases' owners to get in touch to have their data restored.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, since the start of 2019, publicly available ElasticSearch clusters have leaked approximately 33 million profiles of Chinese job seekers, over 108 million bets from various online casinos exposing their bettors' PII data, and hundreds of thousands of sensitive legal documents \"not designated for publication.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnother 114 million records of US companies and citizens and over 32 million records of SKY Brasil customers were exposed by misconfigured ElasticSearch databases during November 2018.<br>\n<br>\nIn an effort to minimize the number of leaky instances, ElasticSearch's development team explained back in December 2013 that Elastisearch clusters should never be accessible via the Internet seeing that only local users should have permission to use them.<br>\n<br>\nElastic also advised admins who want to secure their Elastisearch instances to secure the ElasticSearch stack by \"encrypting communications, role-based access control, IP filtering, and auditing,\" to set passwords for the server's built-in users, and to properly configure the instance before deploying it in production.","date":"2019-07-12","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
