That is simply a lie disguised with justice trappings, because Marx himself is raised, educated, and protected by capital and personally supplied by a capitalist called Engels, all without sucking his blood or feasting on his labour.<br>\n<br>\nThis fact alone shows that Marx himself did not care about what 'level of philosophy' he was on, for he cared in fact more about how to arouse the workers for the social movement he saw fit, i.e. to lash out, to release anger and frustration, to howl that no one an ignore, and to shake those capitalist vampires he deemed as evil. <br>\n<br>\nMarx's doctrines becoming the life strategy of a whole generation or two of European youth is something beyond a person's 'level' of philosophy, quite irrelevant to Marx himself actually.<br>\n<br>\nHis 'philosophy' is in fact a strategy and approach for social power, and for the leader of communism only, not academic position, nor truth or knowledge.<br>\n<br>\nAsking questions like 'how good is Karl Marx in philosophy' would be a bad dry humour to Marx himself, for it is out of a habit of hero-worshipping, but not fit for anything else, even his long out-of-date purpose.","parentType":"question","parentId":13889}
