You can even have the phrase 'war theatre' which indicates the geographical locations or regions where battles between military corps are fought. Nowadays war theatres may include cyber and orbital space.<br>\n<br>\nEach of these three words has many meanings according to context, pure memorizing or treating them like a scientific investigation will carry you no where in the sense of actually using English language.<br>\n<br>\nThe KEY of using languages is always about what you want to say, and how you would like to say it. Without actually doing it and obtaining your own voice, linguistic knowledge will have zero benefit to you.","parentType":"question","parentId":14590}
