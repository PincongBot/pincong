The book's author, Margaret Atwood, has never specifically mentioned the group as being the inspiration for her work. A New Yorker profile of the author from 2017 mentions a newspaper clipping as part of her research for the book of a different charismatic Catholic group, People of Hope. Newsweek regrets the error.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n当然像这种先把消息放了等大家都在传，之后再找个没什么人看的见的角落里发个correction/retraction也算是媒体传统艺能了","date":"2020-09-26","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
