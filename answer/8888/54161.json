And then I got a letter, from the Tibetan Foundation that they want to go and be helpful. And that made me cry. And they ask me if I would write a quote about that and I said,“I would.”And it was a big lesson to me, that sometimes you have to learn to put your head down and be of service even to people who are not nice to you.
