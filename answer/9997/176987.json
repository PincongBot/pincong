After pin-cong.com was cracked down, found pincong.rocks.<br>\n<br>\nEstablishing a non-bias and complete picture is very important, otherwise you'll have a 'confirmation bias'. <br>\n<br>\nI feel very uncomfortable when talking with my fellows. They don't know why Hongkongers fight with the government. They feel dangerous or even be killed if they dare to go to HK, but they are in Mainland. And they also don't know why doctors and nurses join strike in HK during the outbreak of Covid-19. They feel those attendees are stupid.<br>\n<br>\nThey understand what's going on through state-controlled outlets, most opposed information is wiped out. This is 'confirmation bias'.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nI believe many people know Li Wenliang until his death, most of them probably fell very angry and sad that day. But actually they can understand this virus better if they can access a lot of unfiltered information. Because a bunch of news sites and new agencies report this virus as early as early January. <br>\n<br>\nI can gain a lot of useful information on Pincong too.
