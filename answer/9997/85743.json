I only know around 2000 characters but I usually get the main idea of a post and also use translation. I've heard about this forum from reddit. I'm also active there but there are mainly expats living in China discussing politics.&nbsp;<br>\nI used to live with very open minded and down to earth people in China. They were very aware of what the government is doing and they were trying to educate themselves on the situation.&nbsp;<br>\nI'm here because I want to have interesting and productive conversations with Chinese. I study politics at a top 50 world university and my focus is on China.<br>\nYourea great job here btw, I enjoy the discussions.","date":"2019-11-23","agreeCount":17,"discussionCount":2}
