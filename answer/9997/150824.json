Some commentary articles and thought-provoking comments made me curious about how the community was. I registered several minutes ago and I was intended to leave the first comment here in Chinese, a second thought encouaged me to do it in English. Using RSS helps me to get many different information outside of the firewall, while the ProgramThink might be my mentor helps me to build a critical mindset. After several years' reading and thinking, I learned to get information from various channels rather than the domestic media. Information-quotient is quite essential while neglected by the public. Tailored information about 2019-nCoV has led to a tradgy in China and the world. Joining Pingcong is a fresh start for me to widen my horizon and participate in the heated discussion, and I think it's definitly a good platform!","date":"2020-02-04","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
