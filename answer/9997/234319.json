Thought this would've been an interesting forum to explore, but the ridiculous restrictions and the ignorant commentary has thankfully stopped me from going further. This place is almost on par with r/t_d, Im genuinely impressed! Please impose even more restrictions, to prevent the 5 cent army of course! Apparently yall want 100 words from me but I aint writing an essay, so have a google translated version of my sincere message!<br>\n<br>\n从隔离区感到无聊。本以为这将是一个有趣的论坛，但是可笑的限制和无知的评论使我无法继续前进。我真的很感动这个地方与r / t_d相当！请强加更多的限制，以防止5美分的军队！显然你们都想从我这里得到100个单词，但我没有写论文，所以我有一个由谷歌翻译的真诚信息！","date":"2020-04-10","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
