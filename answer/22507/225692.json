These changes may not come dramatically and overnight, but gradually. There will be a whole new generation of young HK Chinese with their very own ideas about life. I am not politically minded but I sincerely hope China can learn to accept HK's liberal system and that she does not try to suppress it or change it too radically. It would be smart for her to allow the HK people the freedom to develop in their own way. I think a critical time will be from 1993 to 1997 because many people will realise then that it's their last chance to get out of HK. Many of those can't manage to get out will probably go on a spending spree and live it up.&nbsp;","date":"2020-04-01","agreeCount":9,"discussionCount":3}
