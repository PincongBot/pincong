Nevertheless, they should be pursued should the virus become endemic in humans (unlike SARS-CoV, which has not been seen since).<br>\n<br>\nAntiviral drugs would be useful for treatment of very sick patients. Remdesvir, a nucleotide analog with potent antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses, including ebolaviruses, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, should be tested for efficacy against 2019-CoV. It has been shown to be superior to a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta, which is being evaluated for treatment of MERS-CoV and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620301835?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2019-CoV infections in humans</a>. With multiple 2019-nCoV virus isolates available, it will be possible to test other existing antivirals or identify new ones.<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\nRemdesvir是一个需要通过身体代谢才会转化成有药性作用的抗病毒药物。目前还在试验阶段，可是因为对Ebola和不同分支的coronavirus貌似有更优于市面anti-viral的性能，正在被高速推。Remdesvir对2019-nCoV有没有效，资料不足，正在研究。<br>\n<br>\n上面的博客个人推荐。<s>推特上的Eric Ding辟谣和消息整理连载也推荐。</s><br>\n<br>\nEric Ding资格和信息质量有待商讨。","date":"2020-02-01","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":4}
