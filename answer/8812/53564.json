They have acted with an exemplary level of restraint and achieved zero fatalities over a huge number of protests and violent encounters, which is frankly amazing. Their handling of protesters has been really gentle compared to globally accepted policing standards. The issue is that the public doesn't appreciate that because they have an unrealistic image of what police work entails. Hats off to the HKPF!<br>\n<br>\n(Certainly they are a lot better than Singaporean riot control forces, who have vehicles with &quot;Disperse or we shoot&quot; painted on them.)<br>\n<br>\nThis is one reason why I feel that a so-called independent investigation (i.e. public lynching after a kangaroo court, let's be honest the public will not accept anything but a guilty verdict) of the police is a demand the government cannot accept. That is so unreasonable after their efforts that the result may be mutiny.<br>\n<br>\n新加坡人说香港警察<br>\nhttps://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hong-kong-protests-and-ongoing-situation.750670/page-74#post-61289728","date":"2019-09-22","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
