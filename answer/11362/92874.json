Not necessarily with my partner, but just in general. With the situation. In love with being watched. In love with being on display. In love with being the center of attention, for those precious thirty-five minutes. Many people say they disconnect themselves when they have porno sex; I’m the opposite. I’m more present than ever. I try to take in everything and let it turn me on more. Rather than numb myself, I take advantage of the situation and take in as much as I can. A producer set this up for me—to have sex with one of the top talents in the world, in front of a camera, giving me this opportunity to turn the world on; why would I remove myself? Why would I try to mentally put myself anywhere but here? I look into my partners’ eyes, and try to portray how much I want them. I tell them how much I like the way they fuck me. I show them how desperate I am for them to feel the same.</blockquote>","date":"2019-12-01","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
