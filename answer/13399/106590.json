It is easy to project an idealized image on this authority figure. <b>But true love only happens between two people at equal station in life.</b> I myself have never understood men who prefer girls significantly younger, or girls who prefer men significantly older. The power imbalance is just too insurmountable.<br>\n<br>\nAsk yourself: would you still feel the same infatuation, 5 years into the future? Which would matter more to &quot;future you&quot;: graduation or some 露水情缘 with your prof?&nbsp; I would pick the former any day. Because I know that many of the same things that would have made me ultra-emotional 5 years ago simply no longer have a hold on me today.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI would encourage you to also think long term.","date":"2019-12-17","agreeCount":7,"discussionCount":4}
