{"type":"answer","id":341306,"parentType":"question","parentId":31074,"uid":55683,"contents":"小粉红和五毛们开始爽起来了，完全不管你国以前计划生育干过的破事，仿佛自己吃过大便但是别人现在吃了，所以就没问题。<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; “The whistleblower complaint alleges that immigrant women were frequently sent to a gynecologist outside the detention center who frequently chose to remove all or a portion of detainees' uterus, or womb.” 俺英文不太好，请赐教这里的chose to是包含强迫的意思吗？<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; \"She also said that one young woman needed an ovary removed because of a cyst but that the doctor removed the wrong ovary — ultimately requiring the removal of both ovaries.\"俺觉得这一个应该是医疗事故吧，移民英文不好沟通不到位，赔钱的问题。<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; \"\"I've had several inmates tell me that they've been to see the doctor and they've had hysterectomies and they don't know why they went or why they're going,\" Wooten said.\"俺觉得很奇妙，是完全不懂英文吗，成年人为啥可以don't know why they went or why they're going。<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; \"\"We've questioned among ourselves like goodness he's taking everybody's stuff out,\" Wooten said, according to the complaint, adding: \"That's his specialty, he's the uterus collector. I know that's ugly … is he collecting these things or something ... Everybody he sees, he's taking all their uteruses out or he's taken their tubes out. What in the world.\"\"这个他没有具名，真实性存疑，但是这个如果是真的，确实很可怕。<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; 总体看来，俺觉得这个新闻不够详细，真相不够明了，可能以后会有更多的报道。YTB上我只看到MSNBC这家媒体在报。","date":"2020-09-17","agreeCount":6,"discussionCount":2}
