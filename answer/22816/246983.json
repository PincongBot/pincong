It does not mean to stand by the President</b>&nbsp;or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth — whether about the President or about anyone else — save in the rare cases where this would make known to the enemy information of military value which would otherwise be unknown to him. ”<br>\n<br>\n简而言之，不批评不说真话才是不爱国的行为。","date":"2020-04-21","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
