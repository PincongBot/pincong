Not one COVID case.<br>\n3，I’m the friend of a 40+ year nurse in Central Florida, all is quiet as far as COVID pts.&nbsp; Don’t believe what the media is feeding you people.&nbsp; We have boots on the ground saying otherwise.&nbsp; SMFH&nbsp; WAKE UP<br>\n4，I’m a med/surg RN that works in a hospital in a major city area. I can honestly tell you that the reported ‘spike in COVID cases’ is a bunch of BS. No new cases in the hospital, no new deaths to report. This virus has been politicized. Period.<br>\n5，My Niece said Houstan and another metro area said for the citizens to calm down the hospitals are not over flowing. Not to mention the weather channel said to keep an eye out for the dust cloud from africa,if you have lungs and sinus(allergies) issues.<br>\n6，They are firing white medical professionals in Westchester County to cover up their scams.<br>\n7，As a nurse in Hellinois the hospitals in my area had to furlough 1/3 of nurses and cut pay by 1/3 for the ones working.&nbsp; No covid here ma'am. And hospitals aren't hiring. No jobs either. SMH.","date":"2020-07-01","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":1}
