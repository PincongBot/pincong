The author talks about the recent outbreak of the coronavirus and Carrie Lam's public policy in this article but not much about how Hong Kong is becoming a failed state.<br>\n<br>\nAs a Hong Kong citizen, I have to admit that what the author talks about in this article is the truth, especially how Carrie Lam has&nbsp;so&nbsp;little legitimacy<b>&nbsp;</b>and social capital that citizens simply no longer believe this fucking moron will act in our interests when the crisis comes from the mainland.<br>\n<br>\nThe comparison with Singapore and Caracas is heart-breaking but that is what Hong Kong is going through under the current situation. Hong Kong's high dependence on mainland China's economic situation makes it necessary to fight for China to have a more modern political system and economic situation in order to regain its glory as an international financial center.<br>\n<br>\nGod Kills CCP!<br>\nGod liberates China!<br>\nMay people reign, proud and free, now and evermore<br>\nGlory be to thee Hong Kong!","date":"2020-02-12","agreeCount":21,"discussionCount":0}
