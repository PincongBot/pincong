To do so would be not just arrogant, but also intellectually lazy.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing in my control is to live a good life according to my own values. This is easier said than done, but if everyone spends more time trying to improve themselves rather than criticizing \"other Chinese people\", we would all end up in a better place. And of course, China/the Chinese will be much better.","date":"2019-12-10","agreeCount":24,"discussionCount":1}
