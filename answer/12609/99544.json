My course is similar. Mankind at large is what I wish to deal and associate with; and so I have got her, well assured that if I can endure her, I shall have no difficulty in my relations with all the rest of human kind.”<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nhttp://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Sym.+2.10&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0212","date":"2019-12-09","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
