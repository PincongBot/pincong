In 2011 and 2012, he spent several days with Vice-President Joe Biden, his official counterpart at the time, in China and the United States. Biden told me that Xi asked him why the U.S. put “so much emphasis on human rights.” Biden replied to Xi, “No President of the United States could represent the United States were he not committed to human rights,” and went on, “If you don’t understand this, you can’t deal with us. President Barack Obama would not be able to stay in power if he did not speak of it. So look at it as a political imperative. It doesn’t make us better or worse. It’s who we are. You make your decisions. We’ll make ours.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n簡述如下：<br>\n<br>\n強烈排斥美國民主理念的習近平問拜登，美國為何如此強調人權。拜登答，美國總統為人權發聲是美國政治特色，這不會讓美國更好或更差，兩國各自作適合自己的決定。","date":"2020-04-23","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
