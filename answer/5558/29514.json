These are more dangerous than out-and-out reactionaries, for latter at least march under their true colors, whereas moderate left-wing leaders confuse people by employing devices of socialism to serve interests of reactionary capital.<br>\n<br>\n(a) Everything must be done to advance relative strength of USSR as factor in international society. Conversely, no opportunity must be missed to reduce strength and influence, collectively as well as individually, of capitalist powers.<br>\n(b) Soviet efforts, and those of Russia’s friends abroad, must be directed toward deepening and exploiting of differences and conflicts between capitalist powers. If these eventually deepen into an \"imperialist\" war, this war must be turned into revolutionary upheavals within the various capitalist countries.<br>\n(c) \"Democratic-progressive\" elements abroad are to be utilized to maximum to bring pressure to bear on capitalist governments along lines agreeable to Soviet interests.<br>\n(d) Relentless battle must be waged against socialist and social-democratic leaders abroad.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n再次推荐共党的治民宝典：商君书<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHB5iKKzt0&amp;t=7829s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHB5iKKzt0&amp;t=7829s</a>","date":"2019-07-13","agreeCount":6,"discussionCount":0}
