This city of skyscrapers, which had a gorgeous hypermodern train station, was silent.<b> It was a ghost town.</b> And behind every window of these skyscrapers we drove past, there were people. There are 15 million people staying put in one place for weeks at a time to stop this disease.<br>\n<br>\n整理稿：两天前，梁教授和我到达武汉时，城市变得不一样了，充满着高楼大厦，火车站是现代化的城际交通枢纽，然而一切却陷入沉寂。【这里有一句被信达雅了】那些高楼大厦里面的灯光，是1500万的武汉人民，他们几个星期静静地待在家里。<br>\n<br>\n专家明确唯有瑞德西韦一种药物目前看似有效<br>\n<br>\n原话：In this country, outside, we have long lists of research projects and studies. But we’ve got to prioritize those things that could get the knowledge we need to stop this faster and the tools we need to reduce the morbidity and mortality. <b>And I’ll give you one good example. There’s only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. And that’s Remdesivir, as you’ve heard about.</b> And Cao Bin is having trouble recruiting patients not just because the numbers are falling, but also because we’re doing lots of other studies with things that are less promising. <br>\n<br>\n整理稿：我们向全球提出的最后一点建议是，这一段争取来的宝贵时间要用好，尽管我们列出了很长的研究清单，但也强调研究项目应该有优先次重，以便快速地掌握知识以进一步阻断病毒传播，进一步降低重症率及病死率。<b>我们认为瑞西韦德可能有预期效力。</b>比如我见到研究人员曹彬说现在招募病人变难了，不仅是因为病例减少了，而是同时还有其他的多种药品在开展试验，而那些药物并未见得有多么大的希望。","date":"2020-02-26","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
