Philosophy and mathematics are never the strong traits of the Sinic civilization, even normal writing and communication are suffering the same weakness. Thus unfortunately, Chinese have to kiss goodbye to advanced sciences, the powerful tools for a modern civilization.<br>\n<br>\nSome expressions in people's daily life, Chinese language can do better, especially poems, but not much help of gaining advantages over another civilization.","date":"2020-01-13","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
