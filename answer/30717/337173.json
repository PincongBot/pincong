He “became physically resistive”, which caused the officer to lose his handcuffs, according to the department.&nbsp;”这个黑人男孩告诉警察他已经18岁，并且与警察发生肢体冲突导致警察丢了手铐只能手动摁住他。后面纽约时报对小孩本人的报道也证实了这件事。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n最后，“Chief Adams said the police department was trying to arrange a meeting between the officer and the boy.<br>\n<br>\n“I want you to know that this isn’t the way I would have liked to have start as the chief,” she said.“<br>\n<br>\n“The officer, whose name was not released, has also been temporarily reassigned to a role outside the police department”看看美国警察是怎么处理的。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n我真觉得品葱现在很多人连上谷歌搜一下新闻都不大会，难怪经常会被粉蛆带着节奏走。<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n其实很多时候这种新闻你只要追踪下去，就能发现美国民主制度的可贵。比如这个视频发出来之后，很多萨克拉门托本地的议员和民间维权组织就出来替小孩发声表示要替他讨回公道，包括现在民主党副总统候选人贺锦丽，且不说这些人在选举的时候的立场如何，但是这种对警察的监督本身就是民主的所在。","date":"2020-09-09","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
