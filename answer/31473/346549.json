{"type":"answer","id":346549,"parentType":"question","parentId":31473,"uid":29684,"contents":"我找了一下兩天前的新聞，有個媒體總結了他的採訪內容，這段是這位顧問的原話：<br>\n<b>&nbsp;[b]CONFRONTING CHINA:</b>[/b]\"I think we all recognize China poses a growing challenge, arguably the biggest challenge, we face from another nation state: economically, technologically, militarily, even diplomatically. And, you know, the relationship has adversarial aspects, competitive aspects, but also cooperative ones. So I think the question we have to ask ourselves is, 'What is the most effective strategy to protect and advance our security, our prosperity, our values when it comes to engaging with China?' And I think the Vice President would tell you that we have to start by putting ourselves in a position of strength from which to engage China so that the relationship moves forward more on our terms than on theirs.\"<br>\n<br>\n這段話基本是在說，面對這樣的中國，應該採取怎樣的對策，而拜登的做法是之後和中國打交道要美國帶頭而不是被動的前進。是的拜登的團體不想脫鉤，但他們也沒大膽到說脫鉤不現實。<br>\n<br>\n感想一是，這基本是川普過去幾年的做法，主動推進關係，但中國因為不停朝三暮四最後川普失去了耐心。<br>\n<br>\n感想二是，中國現在的報紙如果是採用外國的報道，就索性別當翻譯讀了，你就當他們把對方的文字全部翻譯了一遍然後整個拆散重組在加點維尼語錄，生成了篇不倫不類黑屁文好了。","date":"2020-09-26","agreeCount":9,"discussionCount":1}
