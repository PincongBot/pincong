Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?<br>\n<br>\n伯尼的支持者也开始对沃伦&nbsp;“Pocahontus” （妈的，这词还拼错了）飙垃圾话了，所有人都知道她的竞选已经结束所以大家都想分她的潜在选票。布隆伯格(Mini Mike B)也在试，但只来了很小一群而且很快就离开了。沃伦对伯尼很不满。我看他们是撕逼了？<br>\n<br>\nReally Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!<br>\n<br>\n真是个大新闻啊（我玩你呢）：Booker这个民调为0的货，刚刚退出了初选。现在我可以好好休息了。我好怕有一天和他一对一啊（我真的好怕啊！）","date":"2020-01-13","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":1}
