On admission, the patient presented clinical signs and radiological patterns frequently seen previously in the Chinese12&nbsp;and Italian13&nbsp;cohorts. Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and its spreading in the country. Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December, 2019.","date":"2020-05-05","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
