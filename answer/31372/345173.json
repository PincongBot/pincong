There Adams agitated for the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the President.Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency, the latter of which was vociferously opposed by Adams, who contended that it was far beneath the presidential dignity, as the executives of the states, some of which were also titled \"President\" (e.g. the President of Pennsylvania), at that time often enjoyed the style of Excellency; Adams said that the President \"would be levelled with colonial governors or with functionaries from German princedoms\" if he were to use the style of Excellency. On further consideration, Adams deemed even Highness insufficient and instead proposed that the Executive, both the President and the Vice President (i.e., himself), be styled Majesty, with only which the \"great danger\" of insufficient dignity being attached to the executive could be solved. Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them \"the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of\", while Benjamin Franklin considered it \"absolutely mad\".he proposal came to naught, and American Presidents, from Washington onwards, have eschewed honorific titles and styles altogether and are simply referred to as Mr. President.","date":"2020-09-24","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
