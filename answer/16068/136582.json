When patients die, corpses just lie on the ground, uncared for, all the medical staff are near mental breakdowns, and the hospital leadership/administration have given up.<br>\nPatients cluster up in closed rooms, some patients are hysterical, some collapse to the floor, throwing away their money, they are also near breakdown, and the situation is only getting further out of control<br>\n<br>\nThe situation in Wuhan is no longer a matter of medical treatment, if the hospital systems collapse, the consequences make one shudder. I am not being alarmist, nor am I making 'fake news', horrific videos are being shared like wildfire, if you want to see them, I can provide them. It is becoming a humanitarian crisis, please share this, and ask for help from the international society.","date":"2020-01-24","agreeCount":64,"discussionCount":4}
