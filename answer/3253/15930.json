{"type":"answer","id":15930,"parentType":"question","parentId":3253,"uid":3712,"contents":"To side step the concerns about where the soul lies, let me attempt to answer the second question about what the difference is between a human and a machine with respect to ethics.<br>\nA machine is an artificial device, constructed deliberately and based on scientific rules (by definition, otherwise it is magic). And so, whatever outward appearance a machine may have (simulating a human in every respect), it is ostensibly a&nbsp;<i>repeatable</i>&nbsp;process to create another identical machine with the identical characteristics and exactly repeatable behavior.<br>\nHowever, a human has to be born and tended to for years. There is no such thing as an exact replica of a human, no clone popping out of an artificial womb to look and act like an identical twin. There is no recreating an individual human. The effort is unobtainable.<br>\nThis difference is why turning off a machine, even though looking and acting like a human, somehow doesn't feel of the same ethical 'badness' as turning off (killing?) a human.<br>\nThen there's also the more petty 'humans are one of us and machines aren't'.","date":"2019-04-05","agreeCount":-1,"discussionCount":0}
