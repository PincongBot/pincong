Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words 'to make money' hold the essence of human morality.<br>\n<br>\n艾恩·兰德: 如果您要我说出美国人最引以为傲的区别，我会选择-因为它包含了其他的所有区别-他们是创造'<i>为了赚钱</i>'一词的人。<br>\n以前没有其他语言或民族曾经使用过这些字语；人们一直认为财富是固定数量的，要被抢夺，乞求，继承，分享，掠夺或由偏爱获得。美国人是第一个了解必须创造财富的人。 “赚钱”的<b><i>赚</i></b>字具有人类道德的精髓。","date":"2020-06-02","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":1}
