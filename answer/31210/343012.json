The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.<br>\n<br>\n4It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.<br>\n<br>\n5That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow.
