(unsub, stop sc<br>\nI think holo must be burned in order to stop them from kicking COCO out.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I heard that the Reddit is somewhat controlled by Artia and other Nmslese parties. How could we do stop that or how to burn it stronger under this suppression?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I was frequently asked by Gaihoku Aniki that why Artia is bad, or how to prove the one say \"Hold our bottom line\" is Artia, and I am not a Chinese so don't know how to prove. It is really important to build up untrust between Reddit manager Artia with her nmslese army and the Aniki. (d8 or v8 is related? how?)<br>\n<br>\nJust want to make sure hololive is burnt and little pink will lose their entertainment, also protect the talents from CCP, like Kson.<br>\n<br>\nThanks a lot, you could just reply to this badly written post by Chinese, I just too silly and didn't learn mandarin pinyin typing.","date":"2020-09-29","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
