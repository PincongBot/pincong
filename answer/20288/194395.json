State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;CDC is no longer reporting the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) that have been tested, as well as PUIs that have tested negative. Now that states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC’s numbers are not representative all of testing being done nationwide.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;真是无语，还有脸去抹黑别的国家，就好像别人都黑自己就不黑了一样。","date":"2020-03-05","agreeCount":14,"discussionCount":7}
