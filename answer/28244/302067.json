In this form of&nbsp;<i>Sippenhaft</i>&nbsp;the relatives of persons accused of crimes against the state were held to share the responsibility for those crimes and subject to arrest and sometimes execution. Many people who had committed no crimes were arrested and punished under&nbsp;<i>Sippenhaft</i>&nbsp;decrees introduced after the failed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">20 July plot</a>&nbsp;to assassinate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adolf Hitler</a>&nbsp;in July 1944.<br>\n<br>\nExamples of&nbsp;<i>Sippenhaft</i>&nbsp;being used as a threat exist within the&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wehrmacht</a></i>&nbsp;from around 1943. Soldiers accused of having \"blood impurities\" or soldiers conscripted from outside of Germany also began to have their families threatened and punished with&nbsp;<i>Sippenhaft</i>. An example is the case of&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzergrenadier\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panzergrenadier</a></i>&nbsp;Wenzeslaus Leiss, who was accused of desertion on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eastern Front</a>&nbsp;in December 1942. After the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Düsseldorf</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gestapo</a>&nbsp;discovered supposed Polish links in the Leiss family, in February 1943 his wife, two-year-old daughter, two brothers, sister and brother-in-law were arrested and executed at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a>. By 1944, several general and individual directives were ordered within divisions and corps, threatening troops with consequences against their families. After 20 July 1944 these threats were extended to include all German troops, in particular, German commanders. A decree of February 1945 threatened death to the relatives of military commanders who showed what Hitler regarded as cowardice or defeatism in the face of the enemy. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the surrender of Königsberg</a>&nbsp;to the Soviets in April 1945, the family of the German commander General&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lasch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Otto Lasch</a>&nbsp;were arrested. These arrests were publicized in the&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkischer_Beobachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Völkischer Beobachter</a></i>.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the failure of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">20 July plot</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SS</a>&nbsp;chief&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heinrich Himmler</a>&nbsp;told a meeting of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauleiter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Gauleiter</i>s</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Posen</a>&nbsp;that he would \"introduce absolute responsibility of kin ... a very old custom practiced among our forefathers\". According to Himmler, this practice had existed among the ancient&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutons\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Teutons</a>. \"When they placed a family under the ban and declared it outlawed or when there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_feud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blood feud</a>&nbsp;in the family, they were utterly consistent. ... This man has committed treason; his blood is bad; there is traitor's blood in him; that must be wiped out. And in the blood feud the entire clan was wiped out down to the last member. And so, too, will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Count Stauffenberg</a>'s family be wiped out down to the last member.\"<br>\n<br>\nAccordingly, the members of the family of von Stauffenberg (the officer who had planted the bomb that failed to kill Hitler) were all under suspicion. His wife,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Schenk_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Stauffenberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg</a>, was sent to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensbr%C3%BCck_concentration_camp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ravensbrück concentration camp</a>&nbsp;(she survived and lived until 2006). His brother Alexander, who knew nothing of the plot and was serving with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Greece\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Wehrmacht</i>&nbsp;in Greece</a>, was also sent to a concentration camp. Similar punishments were meted out to the relatives of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Goerdeler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carl Goerdeler</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_von_Tresckow\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Henning von Tresckow</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_von_Trott_zu_Solz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adam von Trott zu Solz</a>&nbsp;and many other conspirators.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Erwin Rommel</a>&nbsp;opted to commit suicide rather than be tried for his suspected role in the plot in part because he knew that his wife and children would suffer well before his own all-but-certain conviction and execution.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the 20 July plot, numerous families connected to the Soviet-sponsored&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Committee_for_a_Free_Germany#League_of_German_Officers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">League of German Officers</a>&nbsp;made up of German prisoners of war, such as those of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_von_Seydlitz-Kurzbach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">von Seydlitz</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paulus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paulus</a>, were also arrested. Unlike a number of the 20 July conspirators families, those arrested for connection to the League were not released after a few months but remained in prison until the end of the war. Younger children of arrested plotters were not jailed but sent to orphanages under new names: von Stauffenberg's children were renamed \"Meister\".<br>\n<br>\nPresent legal status<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n資料來自Wikipedia","date":"2020-07-09","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":2}
