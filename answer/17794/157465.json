We cannot be sure of current practices in the absence of evidence, but given that they already hold government and Chinese Communist Party jobs, <b>we would guess that this activity is a requirement of their existing job or at least rewarded in performance reviews</b>.（emphasis added）</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n如果還有興趣的話推薦看下那幾位作者的另一篇論文或者在youtube搜索 “哈佛大学 五毛报告&quot;<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/randomized-experimental-study-censorship-china\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation&nbsp; By King, Pan, and&nbsp; Roberts (2014)<br>\n<br>\n</a>","date":"2020-02-09","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
