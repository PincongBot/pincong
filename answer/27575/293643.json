The early adopters of English spelling relied on digraphs (sets of two letters) to extend the alphabet, rather than diacritics. So historically, we just “worked around” the problem of fitting Latin letters to English sounds.<br>\n<br>\nModern English had a dieresis that separated vowels in words like<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>coöperation</li><li>coërcion</li><li>naïve</li></ul><br>\nBut as you can see above, when written without the dieresis, these words are just as easy to pronounce. (Admittedly, do you do still sometimes see them, but they are rare.)<br>\n<br>\nOptionally, some late-borrowed words occasionally retain diacritics from the language they were borrowed from, such as:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>café</li><li>José</li><li>résumé</li></ul><br>\nAnd don’t get me started on Blue Öyster Cult.","date":"2020-06-22","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":3}
