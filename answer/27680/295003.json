Meng's case still has two phrases in Canada, if the legal system deemed the arrest unconstitutional, that she could be sent back to China, the Michaels may live. The next time China want a favor from Canada, they will be released as an exchange of \"kind will\". If Meng is to be sent to the U.S., then these two Michaels might vanish from the surface of earth without a trace, like many Chinese people that defied the regime. <br>\n<br>\nIf Canadian back down now, China will know this strategy works, and from this point on they will arrest any foreigner as an act to pressure or bully said country, no one will be spared. Regardless of the outcome, I would advise any single (in a relationship aspect) foreigners in China to travel back to their own countries or to the neighboring countries.","date":"2020-06-24","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
