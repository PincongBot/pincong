Recently, she has frequently posted hate speeches on WeChat, which is a widespread social media platform with billions of active users. In her hate posts, she says:\" Shame on USCIS which makes me speechless and disgusting.\" Followed by this sentence, she says \"I wish the whole country, the United States would die and GO TO HELL\". &nbsp;In another of her posts, she says \"That the United States is a free country is the biggest lie in the world\"</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>I feel threatened by reading her terrorism speech as an U.S. citizen, especially considering the fact that she will be a Green Card holder. I strongly believe thistype of hate and terrorism speech doesn't only threat people around her, bt also bring potential national security risks. </b><br>\n<br>\n<b>You can reach out to me via email for the screenshots and translations of her posts. Please help.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Thanks</b>","date":"2020-08-10","agreeCount":128,"discussionCount":18}
