{"type":"answer","id":92137,"parentType":"question","parentId":12281,"uid":9508,"contents":"The answer is that the U.S. political system is set up for two major parties, because it awards seats in Congress and the presidency with a winner-take-all method.<br>\n<br>\nFrench sociologist Maurice Duverger theorized in the 1950s that this kind of setup leads to what is effectively a two-party system. “Duverger’s law” states that third parties can’t compete because there is no prize for winning, for example, 15 or even 25 percent of the vote. This leads voters to choose candidates who are most likely to win, and it leads the parties to try to broaden their appeal to half of the electorate — and ideally more.","date":"2019-11-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":1}
