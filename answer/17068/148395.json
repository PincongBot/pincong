No one here has said “Bernie is the most libertarian libertarian.”&nbsp; What many of us have said is that Bernie is an Independent who has many positions and ideals that strongly align with Libertarianism.&nbsp; He’s in favor of drug decriminalization; he’s against the Patriot Act and corporations tracking our data in a Surveillance State; he’s against tax payer dollars used to fund resource wars for the elite; he supports states rights on gun policies; he’s against corporate money in elections; he’s against corporate monopolies....&nbsp; Of all the major candidates in politics right now, left or right, Bernie has one of the most solid track records for defending personal rights and freedoms. Aside from raising taxes (a topic that some of you dudes are amazingly obsessed with), he legit agrees with the majority of issues that many Libertarians support.","date":"2020-02-03","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
