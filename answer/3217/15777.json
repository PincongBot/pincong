If your children love Chinese really, then I would suggest you should develop their personal interests. If you read some papers about <b><u>cognitive neuroscience</u></b>, you would know that learning a language like Chinese would develop a specific brain area, which is just for processing character-like language (Japanese, Chinese).<br>\nHowever, Chinese is not a language for science. You should at least let your children learn one more alphabetic language (like English, French, German, etc). The younger they learn, the easier they would feel.<br>\nFor my children, I would let them learn 2 foreign language in childhood (maybe German and English). <br>\nAlways remember that <b><u>language shapes culture, and cultural activities shape your brain.</u></b> In principle, language shapes your brain and consciousness, something like what you can think and imagine. <b><u>Learning more language would broaden your thinking and also the way of thinking.</u></b>","date":"2019-04-04","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
