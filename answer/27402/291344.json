I should have known better,\" Bolton added. \"That same month, on the 30th anniversary of China's massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Trump refused to issue a White House statement. 'That was 15 years ago,' he said, inaccurately. '<b>Who cares about it? I'm trying to make a deal. I don't want anything</b>.' And that was that.\"<br>\n<br>\n我认为这一段极其准确的描写了川普的mindset，而且与川普的各种行为多有印证。川普想要的就是“deal”，这就是他对国际关系的理解。如果时至今日，还有人认为“反共”确实是川普的意图，那我跟这种人也没什么好说的。<br>\n<br>\n当然川普的加速大法事实上有利于反共，这我是认同的。但是川普在全世界搞孤立主义，在美国处理内政缺乏技巧，这些是不是有害于反共，也是一个需要讨论的问题。","date":"2020-06-18","agreeCount":34,"discussionCount":4}
