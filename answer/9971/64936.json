It was that nasty during this election campaign.&nbsp;Did you get the same vibe in Calgary? How about comparing with the previous ones in Alberta? @magrabee&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nManitoba is exactly even(7 for each side). Saskatchewan is Andrew Scheer’s home province.<br>\nBut I agree it’s worrisome for the next government that they will have no representation from the region west of Winnipeg and east of Vancouver. But again it’s a minority. They will prolly be out in 2 yrs.<br>\n<br>\n@<a href=\"/people/%E5%A4%8D%E8%BE%9F%E5%BC%9F%E5%88%B6%E7%9A%84%E4%B9%A0%E4%BA%8C%E8%83%96\">复辟弟制的习二胖&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;that’s a very ignorant comment. First of all I’m not sure how Americans will address that their country has a political leaning to the right? What does that even mean?<br>\nCanada has a long history of healthy democracy. The Liberals and the conservatives have been taking turns forming governments here in this country. And just because the global waves of populism swept Europe and states, it doesn’t mean Canada will follow along. Oh, Mr Bernier in fact lost his own seat is a clear message, nope not in Canada.","date":"2019-10-22","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":2}
