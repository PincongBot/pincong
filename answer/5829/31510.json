He already brought it up and dropped it (including telling Consular-General to tone down a speech) as a trade war quid-pro-quo nothingburger. Let it be handled, if at all, by Pompeo or Senate.<br>\npeople would not be wrong using a general heuristic that Trump simply doesn’t care, in the slightest, about any abstract principles. His interest in China is ONLY about whether/how it plays with his base and his odd, wrong, and firmly held 16th century mercantilist beliefs.<br>\nAside from his Grandpa Racism, casual misogyny, and ideas about alpha male posturing mixed the appearance of wealth... there doesn’t seem to be anything he really ‘believes’ in that anyone should count on. Much less rely upon. Everything else is instrumental &amp; ‘on the table.’<br>\nSo a political crisis as complex as what we have in HK.... no, stay away. He can’t understand it. He couldn’t not make himself the central actor even if did get involved. He would make dumb AF demands no one else is asking for. And he’d do a 180 on the spot like he did last time.","date":"2019-07-22","agreeCount":10,"discussionCount":1}
