However, it really disgusts me when I see Westerners cheer for the communist party and Xi, when they say that the CPC model is preferable to the Western democracies, that the Chinese people “chose” this form of governemnt and therefore it’s justified, and that the measures implemented by CPC are nice because they can prevent “CIA subversion”.</blockquote><br>\n<blockquote>To these people I’d say, I don’t expect you to help us in any way, nor do I expect you to understand what we think and feel as Chinese. But could you please have the decency to at least not cheer at our sufferings? Don’t just form your judgment based on the few months/years you have stayed in Beijing/Shanghai as an expat. Do you have any idea how much privilege you have enjoyed in China simply because you’re not Chinese citizen? You have no idea how ordinary Chinese people are manipulated, exploited, silenced, imprisoned. You have no idea how many are forced to emigrate overseas only to be treated as potential spies.</blockquote><br>\n[/quote]","date":"2020-03-15","agreeCount":8,"discussionCount":1}
