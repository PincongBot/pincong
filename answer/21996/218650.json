This function-specific gene editing provides a powerful method to explore the kinetics of transcription state of engram cells during memory encoding and subsequent consolidation.<br>\n[...]<br>\nFurthermore, promoting memory extinction bearing a traumatic event via genome editing in extinction-ensemble cells might be a potential therapy for anxiety disorders, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder. (p. 8)</blockquote><br>\n最後的實用方向確實是通過控制條件的永久基因編輯（controlled permanent gene editing）提供療愈PTSD的方法。也就是……從生理上忘記過去，愛上老大哥。","date":"2020-03-26","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
