From the impact of broad national policies to the conduct of local town officials, Chinese citizens rate the government as more capable and effective than ever before. Interestingly, more marginalized groups in poorer, inland regions are actually comparatively more likely to report increases in satisfaction<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n漏了這一段<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>Second, the attitudes of Chinese citizens appear to respond (both positively and negatively) to real changes in their material well-being, which suggests that support could be undermined by the twin challenges of declining economic growth and a deteriorating natural environment.</blockquote><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n用經濟發展塞住所有不滿意的嘴。 著報告似乎符合以前的認知。<br>\n<br>\n不過我還是對數據來源很感興趣。不知道是出於什麽考慮，報告只給出了人數，而沒有給出受訪者的地區分佈等信息，而且實際調查是大陸的公司。不知道03-16年對類似的民調有沒有過阻撓或者打壓。 不過16年后沒有數據是一點都不奇怪。 <br>\n<blockquote>Our survey1 contains data from eight separate waves between 2003 and 2016, and records face-to-face interview responses from more than 31,000 individuals in both urban and rural settings.<br>\n<br>\n1. The survey referenced in this brief was designed by the Harvard Ash Center for Democratic Innovation and implemented by a <b>reputable domestic Chinese polling firm </b>（emphasis added)</blockquote>","date":"2020-07-15","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
