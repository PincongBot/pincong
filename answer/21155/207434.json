What will happen to them?<br>\nFolding@home is run by an academic institution (specifically the Pande Group, at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foldingathome.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford University</a>’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://chemistry.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chemistry Department</a>), which is a nonprofit institution dedicated to science research and education. We will not sell the data or make any money from it. Moreover, we will make the data available for others to use. In particular, the results from Folding@home will be made available on several levels. Most importantly, analysis of the simulations will be submitted to scientific journals for publication, and these journal articles will be posted on the web page after publication.<br>\n<br>\nFollowing the publications of these scientific articles, we will make the raw data of the folding runs available to other researchers upon request. The data sets from some of our most prominent simulations are already publicly available. We’ve also striven to share our key technologies with other scientists, to assist their research as well.<br>\n<br>\nWhy don’t you post the source code?<br>\nMost of the critical parts of FAH are publicly available. The Tinker and Gromacs source codes can be downloaded and run. Unlike many computer projects, the paramount concern is not functionality, but the scientific integrity, and posting the source code in a way that would allow people to reverse engineer the code to produce bogus scientific results would make the whole project pointless. However, we stress that the vast majority of our code is already open source. We have an Open Source FAQ with more details.","date":"2020-03-16","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
