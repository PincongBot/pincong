Today, CCP already killed us&nbsp; -- 150,000 US people with this man made virus by them – the CCP(Per Dr. Li-Meng Yan)!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you want to win Trump’s supporter’s heart, you need show the real color to CCP!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI recalled in WWII, president Eisenhower, his ancestors were from Germany, but he led our solders in USA to fight against Nazi;<br>\n<br>\nMy friends and me are from China, but we hate CCP,&nbsp; some logic,&nbsp; because they are too evil and do a lot of&nbsp; <b>crimes against humanity.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Secondly, how do we do to fight the New Nazi -- CCP? </b><br>\n<br>\na)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should rely on our allies: 5 eyes, Germen, Japan, France, Taiwan and so on;&nbsp; inside US we also should rely on Democrats as well as Republicans including &nbsp;Mr. Mike Pompeo and Steve Bannon, they are some kind of bad, however, they are our coalition force to help us to push CCP (the most evil enemy in our human history) down. In this point, they are so good.<br>\n<br>\nBTW, I support the BLM movement, for now the Anti-CCP&nbsp; is the 1st priority.<br>\n<br>\nb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a warning message from our human history:&nbsp; in a competition (war or other kind of political games), strong/powerful, and honest force may not always win(like we beaten the Nazi in WWII), many times we lost.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the&nbsp; most famous example: SIX FALLEN STATES.<br>\n<br>\n（<a href=\"https://www.oktranslation.com/news/twininfo46036.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oktranslation.com/news/twininfo46036.html</a>）<br>\n<br>\nIt happened 2000 years ago. China was 7 independent states: Qin, Yan, Zhao, Chu, Qi and so on.<br>\n<br>\nQin was NOT the most powerful one and was not the most advanced civilization either (Chu, Qi and Zhao all had more advantage in science and technology); as well as, Qin’s military strength is not the most powerful one.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, finally Qin Won, sadly&nbsp;others ----- 6 states all had fallen, no matter how nice the kings and people were, millions of them been killed.<br>\n<br>\n2000 years ago, in our human’s history, &nbsp;Qin is the 1st fascist country in the world (it is not Benito Mussolini), it is so evil as same as Nazi in WWII.<br>\n<br>\nOne example, Qin won the battle Changping and defeat Zhao state – the most powerful (military) country, and then Qin executed 400,000 Zhao’s war prisoners!<br>\n<br>\nWhy Qin won? Even it was so evil and, in some areas it was not so strong?<br>\n<br>\nHow Qin won finely?<br>\n<br>\nThe reason is here: 1000 years ago, in Song Dynasty, a famous posits Su-Xun wrote an essay to describe the root cause,&nbsp;&nbsp; please see appendix 1 “Six Fallen states”.<br>\n<br>\n<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>“ The fall of the Six States was not owing to their inferior weaponry or lost battles but to their bribing the State of Qin, resulting in the undermining of their strength, which was in fact the cause of their ruin. One may ask: Since the Six States perished one after another, was this all due to their bribing Qin? The answer is: The ones that did not bribe it perished because of the ones that did. For a state could not survive without a strong support. That is why I say that bribing Qin was at the bottom of their collapse.</b></i><b>”</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>The entire isaay see appendix 2</b><br>\n<br>\nThe purpose of writing this letter to you, it is:<br>\n<br>\nToday, CCP is not as powerful/strong as our US , the Science and Technology is not as good as Japan, Germany, however,&nbsp; as described in “6 Fallen States”, US and our coalition force &nbsp;may not 100% win!<br>\n<br>\nIn “Six Fallen States” Mr. Su discovered: the Six Fallen States they were fighting each other (like Trump and us , we are fighting now today), unable to&nbsp; unite each other, they were also bribed&nbsp; Qin.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Arthur Neville Chamberlain</b><br>\n<br>\nIt is the same as the example of the destruction of the SIX STATES revealed in \"Six FallenStates\". During World War II, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain adopted the same policy of appeasement towards Germany:<br>\n<br>\nFRS (/ˈtʃeɪmbərlɪn/; 18 March 1869 – 9 November 1940) was a British politician of the Conservative Party who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from May 1937 to May 1940. He is best known for his foreign policy of appeasement, and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, conceding the German-speaking Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany.<br>\n<br>\nAfter signed up, at the airport, Chamberlain waved the agreement and declared, \"This is the second time in history that the British Prime Minister has brought back a dignified peace from Germany. I believe this is the peace of our time.\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain</a><br>\n<br>\n·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason&nbsp; we can not trust CCP: <b>Scientific evidence and logic behind the claim that the Wuhan coronavirus is man-made</b><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://nerdhaspower.weebly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://nerdhaspower.weebly.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More about CCP ----fascists &nbsp;and military virus, you can find here:<br>\n<br>\nChi Haotian: \"War is not far from us, it is the midwife of the Chinese century\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://bbs.aboluowang.com/thread-27164-1-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://bbs.aboluowang.com/thread-27164-1-1.html</a> (I will translate asap)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI &nbsp;may ask , Whom keeps feeding CCP, whom made the evil CCP growing so powerful?<br>\n<br>\nThe answer: ”It is us&nbsp; ----- The US.”<br>\n<br>\nYes, from Senior George Bush, Bill Clinton as well as Obama, especially Bill Clinton times and Obama times,&nbsp; we allow China to join the WTO, feed / raise China stronger and stronger, they are doing stealing; and if Trump and then you keep doing&nbsp; the same,&nbsp; China will become Qin and all of us will become its foods.<br>\n<br>\n<b>So, be vigilant!</b><br>\n<br>\nWe should be smart and united.<br>\n<br>\nBTW,&nbsp; I always vote left wing party –Democrats, I like the&nbsp; UK Labour Party, &nbsp;etc.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, before I hate Steve Bannon, and Secretary Pompeo,&nbsp; but after the pandemic happened, I do believe most of their jobs&nbsp; -- to fight against&nbsp; CCP, are correct.
