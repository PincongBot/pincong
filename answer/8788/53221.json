This is not surprising, the same thing happened in many fields. Hitler's views were presumably similar to those of the party that followed him.<br>\n<br>\nThe core of Nazi policy was the idea of \"race\" and its fundamental importance to&nbsp;<i>everything</i>. An individual's own body was not their own to do with as they wished, but belonged to the German race.

Motherhood was viewed as the most important activity for women, serving the race in an equivalence of the way men served it as soldiers. However, they didn't try to hide and deny sexuality, but to turn it to their ends in increasing the population.</blockquote><br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China</a><br>\n<blockquote><b>Homosexuality in China</b>&nbsp;has been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history_in_China\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a>&nbsp;in China since ancient times.
