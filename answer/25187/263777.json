We have the greatest capacity in the world. But for the most part, they shouldn't want to get tested. There's no reason. They feel good, they don't have sniffles, they don't have sore throats, they don't have any problem. If they feel something happening, they have absolute easy.. in fact Ron DeSantis of Florida, the governor's doing a fantastic job in Florida. He said he got a little bit of opposite problem. He's got so much testing that people sit around and wait for people come in that they have far great over capacity for testing and there are numerous other states that have told me the same thing. That's by the way a good problem not bad problem.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n簡單翻譯就是現在美國檢測能力全世界最高。美國人想檢測都可以得到病毒檢測。問題是部分人不需要，他們又沒鼻塞，喉嚨又不痛，幹嘛要測試呢？但如果他們覺得有不對，完全可以檢測。但佛州州長說他們的問題，他們檢測能力很高，一堆檢測人員坐着等人來檢測，還有哦好幾個州都說同樣地事情。當然這是好的狀況，不是壞的。<br>\n<br>\n亞裔女記者：爲什麼你要把測試說到世界競爭一樣？美國每天都有人死欸！<br>\n<br>\n哈囉！看完川普的發言？請問川普有把測試說成世界競爭嗎？有嗎？有嗎？記者的用意是想把話塞川普嘴，延伸出川普就是反全球化，就是什麼都是American First，拒絕與世界合作，拒絕跟WTO合作，所以美國才死一堆人。想弄一齣好戲，結果川普不配合演出。記者塞話不成，就惱羞成怒。<br>\n<br>\n可憐吶！","date":"2020-05-13","agreeCount":21,"discussionCount":0}
