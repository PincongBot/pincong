A lie is a statement that is known to be untrue and is used to mislead. A false statement is a statement that is untrue but not necessarily told to mislead, as a statement given by someone who does not know it is untrue.<br>\n<br>\nIn U.S. law, a \"false statement\" generally refers to United States federal false statements statute, contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Most commonly, prosecutors use this statute to reach cover-up crimes such as perjury, false declarations, and obstruction of justice and government fraud cases. Its earliest progenitor was the False Claims Act of 1863, and in 1934 the requirement of an intent to defraud was eliminated to enforce the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) against producers of \"hot oil\", oil produced in violation of production restrictions established pursuant to the NIRA.<br>\n<br>\nThe statute criminalizes a government official who \"knowingly and willfully\":<br>\n<br>\n(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;<br>\n(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or<br>\n(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.","parentType":"answer","parentId":174800}
