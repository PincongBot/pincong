Bohai Harvest has put money into an automotive firm, mining companies, and technology ventures, such as Didi Chuxing Technology, one of the largest ride-hailing companies in the world after Uber. (Hunter Biden, Bohai Harvest, and Joe Biden’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)”是真的，他和中共的直接利益联系的确是石锤。<br>\n<br>\n抱歉，我的确对政治不敏感，也从来没看过intercept的报道，不知道这个网站的credibility怎么样。我一般只读WSJ和reuters这两个地方，以经济为主。如果intercept的报道是credible，那么Biden我可以放弃了。","parentType":"answer","parentId":51115}
