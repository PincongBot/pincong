Even if you are at the top of the society, your descendants will gradually lose socioeconomic status because of &quot;多多繁衍后代&quot; and &quot;分家&quot;. That's why 富有的家族若想保住其经济地位，而不是随时光推移被风吹雨打去，其每一代人就都得发挥极高聪明才智，利用极其敏锐的商业触觉，努力工作，勤奋不懈，从拥有的田地及他人处榨取大量的财富，才能做到这一点。<br>\n<br>\nAlso, because traditional Chinese values males over females, there are not enough Chinese women for all the Chinese men to marry. So Chinese men at the bottom of the society face harsher fate than those poor Western men in terms of marriage. &quot;尽管与此同期的欧洲贫民无论男女，都很晚结婚，甚至一生单身，但中国人生活的一大主题就是尽早成家，生儿育女。&quot; Coupling this gender inequality with the traditional Chinese value of &quot;不孝有三，无后为大&quot;, all Chinese males must compete even harder.","parentType":"answer","parentId":64803}
