You should have said “because where you stay” instead. Besides you forgot the correct conjunction, which should be “you feel life becomes” instead of “you feel life become”. However interestingly you don’t need to use singular form following I. Correct sentence should be “I speak English better” instead of I speaks better English”. Last but not least, self doubt’s adjective case should be self-doubting. Self-doubt is a noun. I cannot tolerate such an arrogant dumbo showing off his terrible English in front of me. Go study my son 🤣🤣🤣🤣","parentType":"answer","parentId":175580}
