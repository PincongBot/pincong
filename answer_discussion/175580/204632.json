At the moment, I am also learning other languages (e.g. Deutsche and Sprache). To master a language, it takes time to practice and learn from multiple sources (e.g. native speakers and writers). Whining certainly does not do the trick. Besides, talent is not of significant relevance in acquiring a language. I have already proven it myself. Though your problem won't be mine, it all comes down to your initiatives. It's your own call. To act now or die hesitating.","parentType":"answer","parentId":175580}
