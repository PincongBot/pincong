Diversity is based on mutual respect and the existence of strictly secured boundaries, and intermixing will destroy diversity. That same goes for color-mixing: Red is great because it's red, green is great because it's green, blue is great because it's blue, but what would you get when you try to combine them into a unified community? White, the color of inevitable nothingness, the opposite of diversity.","parentType":"answer","parentId":116617}
