To assess whether Tibetans carry more Denisovan admixture than other populations (CEU or CHB), we used the SNP genotype data from Simonson et al. 201045 and computed D-statistics as in Durand et al. 201144: D(chimp, Denisovan, Tibetan and CHB) and D(chimp, Denisovan, Tibetan and CEU). At the genome-wide level, using the D-statistic, we found no evidence that there is more Denisovan admixture in Tibetans than in the Han (D = 0.000504688). We also did not find evidence that there is more Denisovan admixture in Tibetans than in the Europeans (D = 0.001898642).","parentType":"answer","parentId":232341}
