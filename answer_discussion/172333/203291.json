They are separated by residues whose mutations do not affect the S RBD binding to ACE2. Interestingly, six of the mutations we identified to reduce binding are buried but at close proximity to R426 as shown by the translucent surface highlighting in Fig. 6B indicating sensitivity of this area to mutations and likely involvement of other residues. Residues D454 and I455, whose mutation reduced binding to ACE2, do not make contacts with ACE2 and are located on the side opposing the side facing the receptor (right panel of Fig. 6); it is likely that the mutations decrease binding by inducing conformational changes. Other mutations including mutations of the two glycosylations sites on that side do not affect binding to ACE2 (right panels of Fig. 6). These results suggest the existence of two hot spots on the S RBD surface, R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute significant portion of the binding energy.","parentType":"answer","parentId":172333}
