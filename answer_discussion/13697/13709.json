This does not require you have no accent while speaking the second language, though it does require to you speak at least at the level of near-native speakers. Whenever someone questions your identity as a Chinese, such as &quot;why are you not able to speak Mandarin as a Chinese? Shouldn't everyone from China be able to speak Mandarin?&quot;, you should simply respond that you came to the country you are currently living in before your youth, before which you only spoke a dialect (whichever one you do, if you do not speak any dialect other than Mandarin, simply make up one that is rarely spoken by Chinese overseas so that nobody would know you were lying to them) of Chinese instead of Mandarin itself. This forces them to speak the second language to you, but usually Shina people (or Shinese) do not like to talk in the second language to people of Chinese descent. By this way, you should be able to completely get rid of the influences from Shinese near you, and live like a local and forget whatever you have experienced in Shina.<br>\n<br>\nLanguages are critical in the formation of one's thinking. Giving up using Pincong and all other Chinese media, and try your best giving up speaking Chinese and having any connection to China, both culturally and physically. Otherwise, you are always a Shinese from the bottom of your heart, then forget about your idea of de-Shinalization.<br>\n<br>\nIn case the writer of this question does not read English, use Google translate to translate this answer to the language you speak other than Chinese.
