(See cradle of civilization.) Development of Africa and the Americas started on the same path, but it was delayed by thousands of years.<br>\nWith the development of ships in Eurasia, rivers became trade routes. Europe and empires in Greece and Rome benefited from the Mediterranean, compared to Chinese empires (who later built the Grand Canal for similar purposes).<br>\nRaids from the Eurasian Steppe brought diseases that caused epidemics in settled populations.<br>\nThe Social Development Index shows the West leading until the 6th century, China leading until the 18th century, and the West leading again in the modern era.<br>\nAfter the development of ocean-going ships, the significantly greater size of the Pacific Ocean made trans-Atlantic exploration and trade more feasible and profitable for Europe than trans-Pacific exploration and trade for East Asia. Though the mariner's compass was invented in China in the 11th century, Chinese exploration was less successful than the European Age of Discovery and subsequent colonization.<br>\nEurasian diseases to which people in the Americas had no immunity were a byproduct of Eurasian development that devastated Native Americans after contact, in addition to superior European weapons.<br>\nGlobalization and advances in information technology are leveling differences between civilizational areas.","parentType":"answer","parentId":78318}
