He did not feel bound to a two-term limit, but his retirement set a significant precedent. Washington is often credited with setting the principle of a two-term presidency, but it was Thomas Jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds. 所以才变成了这么一句不伦不类的话","parentType":"answer","parentId":166483}
