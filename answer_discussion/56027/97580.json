It's a cat and mouse game where you're the mouse. As frustration mounts, you will eventually <br>\nlearn to limit your online conversations and the content you share on CN social media/IM apps to the confines of completely &quot;safe topics&quot;--baby pictures, cute animals, food and drinks, etc. My advice: stay clear of CN social media/IM apps. Like I said, it's a no-win game unless you choose not to play. If you have to use one, put it on a separate clean device where no sensitive personal data is stored. I use wechat only to keep in touch with family members in China, and that shit is staying on an old beater phone with no sim card that never leaves the house.","parentType":"answer","parentId":56027}
