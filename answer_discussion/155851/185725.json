If they ever fail, they would just return to their home country rather than seeking handouts from the government. <br>\n<br>\nHence... It's safe to assume that with a welfare state, of course border control has to be in place to keep the migrants out from leeching off the system; on the other hand, without a welfare state, there're much fewer incentives for migrants to come, which makes open border possible. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, I personally do support strict border control even without a welfare state, considering the activities of those international crime syndicates, such as human trafficking and drug trade.","parentType":"answer","parentId":155851}
