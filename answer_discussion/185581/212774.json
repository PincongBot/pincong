Genetically, haplotypes of Group A have links to only Wuhan haplotype H3 (only one sample EPI_ISL_406801, with no link to the Hua Nan market). It is possible that H13 was newly derived from H3 in the family from Shenzhen (Figure 3C) and did not spread in Wuhan, or that no samples have been sequenced yet. However, this scenario is not supported by the evolutionary network. H38 has three genomes from the same patient (Table S1), who was the first identified infected patient in the United States.14 He should have been infected while visiting his family in China. The original source of H38 can be explained as that of H13, which is also derived from H3, and the derived H45 was from a Chongqing patient who was working in Wuhan.<br>\n<br>\n看论文的时候还是不要带偏见的好，否则你只看自己想看的，看不到自己不想看的。","parentType":"answer","parentId":185581}
