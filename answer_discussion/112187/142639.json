This is a question not compatible with his mind set, or CCP's. <br>\n<br>\nThe current dilemma for Xi is that he has to choose between the two ultimately the same options:<br>\n<br>\nOne, crush HK and cut the life line of finance for Communist totalitarian regime, which of course means death to the CCP.<br>\n<br>\nTwo, wait and let the fire of revolution burning through the China mainland until it's reached Beijing, which absolutely is a painful and slow process of saying adi√≥s. Of course, it's longer measured in time than option one.","parentType":"answer","parentId":112187}
