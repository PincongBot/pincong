Hong Kong police arrested lawmaker Lam Cheuk Ting for rioting, just because Lam tried to mediate the situation one year ago when HKers were assaulted by pro-Beijing mobs after making 24,000 emergency calls, without response.<br>\n2. Police are found rewriting history today. A year ago when #Hkers were attacked by mobs, police publicly admitted they came 39 minutes late, the same figure in the police watchdog report, but police claimed the delay should be 18 minutes.<br>\n3. When cops were caught by media cameras patting the white-clad mobs’ shoulders, police claimed they were pushing him at that time.<br>\n4. More than just turning lies into truths with disinformation, today’s incident sends a worrying signal to how Hong Kong Government will enforce national security law in the city, where even basic facts can be rewritten to suit the official narrative and justify the future repression.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://telegra.ph/file/fd557739ccde80d61b87e.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://telegra.ph/file/fd557739ccde80d61b87e.png\" alt=\"https://telegra.ph/file/fd557739ccde80d61b87e.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a>","date":"2020-08-27","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
