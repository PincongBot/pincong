Mendacity!<br>\n[Behind] The facade of peace and prosperity, a mountain of skeletons.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe pledged to meet in the spring,<br>\nto fulfill an ancient promise.<br>\nWe sat down shoulder to shoulder in the ship [of state]<br>\nBlooming in our youth,<br>\nwe were moving forward on the path of the light.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe who sailed through death swallowed our tears.<br>\nThe smog covered the Yangtze River; Yellow Cranes flew away.<br>\n[<i>Yangtze River and Yellow Cranes are cultural symbols of Wuhan.</i>]<br>\nThe devil spells its threat as a promise.<br>\nWho is salvaging, and who is lying?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe who fled to all corners of the world must wipe off our tears.<br>\nKindness is all there is left for us to hope for.<br>\nWhat's more terrifying than pestilence?
