The rice bought from Burma, for instance, was shipped directly to Ceylon to meet outstanding commitment. Some 1600,000 tonnes also found their way to East Germany to address the trade deficit with socialist allies. And China, in the midst of famine, continued to be generous to its friends. Two cargoes of wheat carrying some 60,000 tonnes were shipped directly to Tirana from Canadian ports as a gift. Since Albania had&nbsp; a population of about 1.4 million, this amount provided as much as one-fifth if domestic requirement. <br>\n粗译：<br>\n非所有购买的谷物都作为国内消耗。 例如，缅甸购买的大米被直接运送到锡兰，以履行尚未兑现的承诺。 其中160万吨粮食也运往东德，以解决社会主义同盟间的贸易逆差。 而且，在饥荒中的中国继续对国际友人大放水。 有约60,000吨小麦作为礼物从加拿大港口直接运到地拉那（阿尔巴尼亚首府）。以阿尔巴尼亚的人口约为140万，这些粮食可以满足多达五分之一的人口消耗。<br>\n<br>\n好奇中共自开国以来究竟援助了亚非拉多少钱？","date":"2020-03-08","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
