To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.<br>\n摘要<br>\n我们提供了第一次大规模，多源分析的结果，可能是有史以来实施过最广泛的选择性审查人类表达的行为。为此，我们设计了一个系统来定位，下载和分析来自全中国近1,400种不同社交媒体服务的数百万社交媒体帖子的内容，赶在中国政府能进行查找，评估和审查（即，从互联网上删除）他们认为的反抗内容子集。利用我们找到并用中文验证过的现代计算机辅助文本分析方法，我们比较了审查的帖子的实质内容与85个主题领域中每个未审查的帖子。与先前的谅解相反，对国家，其领导人及其政策的负面甚至尖刻批评的帖子不太可能被审查。相反，我们表明，审查计划旨在通过沉默代表，加强或促进社会动员的评论来遏制集体行动，而不论其内容如何。审查制度旨在试图阻止现在或将来可能发生的集体活动 - 因此，它们似乎清楚地暴露了政府的意图。","date":"2019-05-19","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
