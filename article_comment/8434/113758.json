I am Chinese and I love my country above anything else.(开篇表明立场很重要哦）I ORDER you to vote against the bill AT ONCE. Should you choose to disobey my order, there will be severe consequences. (一定要投反对，不然你完了）As you know China is on her way to defeat the U.S. and become world's strongest country, therefore it is for the best that you consider our opinion and align your interests with that of ours. (厉害了我的国）The U.S. government should not interfere with foreign affairs, or we will punish you no matter where you choose to hide. (虽远必诛) The cockroaches in HK are nothing more than puppets of Washington D.C. They get paid to throw Molotovs at the police and stab those who disagree with them on streets. They want to overthrow the government and become independent from China. We will not let that happen! We will slaughter them to the last one and burn the city down if that's what it takes to keep HK in China. You are smart, you know what to choose.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nChoose wisely, vote carefully. Big brother is watching you.&nbsp;","date":"2019-11-16","agreeCount":15,"discussionCount":0}
