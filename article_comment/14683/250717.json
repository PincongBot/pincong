I tried my best and cooked for all. My parents and my wife together, we had a great evening.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, the nightmare haunted our family. On the Chinese New Year Day 1 [Jan. 26], my father started coughing, having a temperature and trouble breathing. We sent him to several hospitals and he couldn't get a bed. We asked for help everywhere and had no luck. Disappointed, we took him home and took care of him ourselves. In a matter of days, he died, with regrets. Struck by his death, my mother was exhausted, mentally and physically. Her immune system collapsed and she passed away with my father soon.<br>\n<br>\nI took care of both of my parents for days. The cruel coronavirus got me and my wife. We visited several hospitals, wept and begged. Unfortunately, we are unimportant and negligible people, there is no bed for us. We are gravely ill now. We missed our chances. In my last breaths, I'd like to tell all my relatives, friends, and my son who is far away in England: All my life, I've been a dutiful son, a responsible father, and a loving husband. I am a sincere man! Farewell, my beloved and those who love me.</blockquote>","date":"2020-02-18","agreeCount":11,"discussionCount":0}
