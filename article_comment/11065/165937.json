It is an internet censor system that blocks IP addresses and “the world’s most&nbsp;<br>\nsophisticated and brutal internet censorship system” (Yuan&nbsp;<i>the Week in Tech</i>,[i]&nbsp;[/i]par. 5). Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began to construct the system since 1998 and has been continually enhancing it (Bu, par. 1).
