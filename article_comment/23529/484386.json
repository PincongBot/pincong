The current reinfection is due to a LACK of IgG antibodies FROM THE START OF THE FIRST INFECTION, where all current vaccinations introduced IgG antibodies in 100% of candidates from phase 1 trials.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, mutations are not necessarily pathogenic. Reports show that the mutation rate of the CCP virus is far slower than what flu does, where no pathogenic mutations have ever occurred in the context of CCP virus. As per the Twitter below, despite mass surveillance, the reinfection rate is only 4/5*10^6, even smaller than Measles and the reinfection does almost nothing in all cases.Only pathogenic mutations affect vaccinations.<br>\n<br>\nThird, there are no documented cases of Antibody-dependent enhancement as of now, including in phase 3 vaccine trials. If there is one it will be on the headline of news immediately after that happens.<br>\n<br>\nYou can read reinfection cases of measles here, where the MMR vaccine has a 95% efficacy: https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1299479311129300994?s=21<br>\n<br>\n如果你看不懂这段话，那你还是不要做键盘免疫学家的好。你的所有言论都受了中共非黑即白的影响。","date":"2020-08-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
