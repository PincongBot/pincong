The proposed act would require the Department of Defense to take steps to ensure Taiwan's ability to thwart a Chinese invasion and specifically a \"fait accompli\" against Taiwan.<br>\n<br>\nIn announcing the bill, Hawley described Taiwan as \"the lynchpin of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\" He added that \"If the Chinese Communist Party is allowed to seize control of Taiwan, it will stand ready to dominate the region. This would pose an unacceptable threat to the lives and livelihoods not just of our Asian allies and partners but of working Americans here at home. We must not allow that to happen.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe bill defines \"fait accompli\" as a situation in which China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) manages to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses before the U.S. military can dispatch forces to the region. Under this scenario, PLA forces would control Taiwan and prevent the U.S. from intervening, giving it no choice but to accept China's annexation of Taiwan.<br>\n<br>\nThe document recommends denial operations including a \"blunt layer\" of forward forces to prevent a fait accompli from taking place. It even recommended assessing the use of U.S. nuclear weapons to deter or defeat fait accompli and ensuring U.S. that forces can continue to defend Taiwan following the use of nuclear weapons by China or the U.S.<br>\n<br>\nYesterday I introduced new legislation to stop #China imperialism and to defend our vital interests, and our partner #Taiwan https://t.co/fL3rZ7DzAj<br>\n— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) June 11, 2020","date":"2020-08-06","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
