During her visit inside the Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto, she took down and disposed several Ema put up by other people, especially those from Hong Kong. <br>\n<br>\nAfter her conduct was exposed on social media, someone in Japan has helped restore the damaged Ema. However, Ms. Fan did not show even the slightest signs of remorse. Instead, she bragged about it on Weibo, and made further threats that she would go back to the shrine and do it again. <br>\n<br>\nSuch hideous act and speech is a tremendous offense against Japanese culture and a violation of Japanese laws. It might as well inflame the dangerous ultra-nationalistic sentiment that advocates further violence. As fellow Chinese people, we feel ashamed. We would like to apologize and would not ask for your forgiveness. In hope of the slightest rectification, we hereby make such petition: Please have Ms. Fan's Japanese visa(s) revoked, and have her listed as an unwelcome person. <br>\n<br>\nInformation on Ms. Fan Ye:<br>\nName in Chinese: 樊烨<br>\nNational ID: 622821199307090025<br>\n<br>\nWe hope that prompt attention is given to the matter. <br>\n<br>\nConcerned, and sincerely,<br>\nA group of Chinese people","date":"2019-09-14","agreeCount":6,"discussionCount":0}
