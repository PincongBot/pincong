Augustus Caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs, but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous, legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations.<br>\n2. Both the Babylonian and Assyrian families were monogamous in principle but not entirely so in practice since polygyny was frequently practiced by the rulers.<br>\n3. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife.<br>\n4. The ancient Greeks and Romans were monogamous in the sense that men were not allowed to have more than one wife or to cohabit with concubines during marriage.<br>\n<br>\n至于人类祖先：Paleoanthropological estimates of the time frame for the evolution of monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism. According to Reno et al., the sexual dimorphism of Australopithecus afarensis, a human ancestor from approximately 3.9–3.0 million years ago, was within the modern human range, based on dental and postcranial morphology.Although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids, the authors do say that reduced levels of sexual dimorphism in A. afarensis \"do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny\".<br>\n<br>\nFrom:<br>\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy#Distribution_of_social_monogamy","date":"2020-03-06","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
