There is no central authority defining what it means to be Muslim. Therefore, as the Pakistani scholar Fazlur Rahman argues, the Sunna and the Quran are \"essentially an ever-expanding process.\" Moreover, the expansion of the Islamic faith across the globe has necessitated greater acceptance of plurality and diversity within Muslim thought and practice. Indeed, the earliest interpretations of Islam came about in political and cultural contexts that have little in common with today's world; therefore, these interpretations require revision and reformulation in light of contemporary circumstances. The challenge, as Sardar puts it, is to rediscover the \"distinguished history of critical thinking in Islam.\" This critical approach means questioning orthodoxy and demanding evidence. Islam does not divide Muslims into groups or categorize them; instead, it embraces diverse social and political groups. Today's critical thinkers should continue to raise questions about all dominant interpretations of the religion as they search for answers to the challenges faced by Muslims across the world. This critique is not purely Islam-centric, but also applies to Western political thought and its conception of the Muslim social world. It attempts to contextualize current problems in their historical and cultural backdrop to understand their origins and complexities. Such an approach brings with it major political and social opportunities, as the legacy of rational Muslim thinkers has become of paramount importance in dealing with the sectarian fault lines that destabilize the Muslim world today. Re-focusing on the historical stream of thought that takes a critical eye to traditional interpretations can change our outlook toward Islam and also transform the narrative associated with the religion.

In turn, conservatives have emphasized the classical traditions and dismissed new ideas. ↝<br>\n14 Ironically, Iqbal was declared the national poet of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. ↝<br>\n15 Mohammad Iqbal, \"The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam,\" (1930), p. 108, PDF available. ↝<br>\n16 Hanif Lakadawala, \"Muslim Intellectual Stagnation,\" Islamic Research Foundation International, available online; Mohammad Iqbal, \"Separate Muslim Nationhood in India,\" Muslim Political Thought: a Reconstruction, ed.

Muslims have historically and hermeneutically considered the early era of Islam as sacred, akin to a \"prophetic revelatory event.\" The Salafi School illustrates this trend, incorporating the medieval epistemology that is commonly found in writings on Muslim jurisprudence, including Dar al-Islam (Abode of Islam), Dar al-Kufr (Abode of Disbelief), and Dar al-Harb (Abode of War). ↝<br>\n28 Adis Duderija, \"Critical-Progressive Muslim Thought: Reflections on Its Political Ramifications,\" The Review of Faith &amp; International Affairs, Vol. 11, no.3 (September 20, 2013), p. 69-79, available online. ↝<br>\n29 Khaled Abou El Fadl, Reasoning with God: Reclaiming Shari'ah in the Modern Age (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014), p. xxxix. ↝<br>\n30 Ibid. ↝<br>\n31 Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender and Pluralism, ed.
