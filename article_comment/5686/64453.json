He attended Castle House School and at 18 he went to Imperial College London,[1] being awarded a first class BSc degree in physics in 1968.[5] He commenced postgraduate research there into superconductivity, but then went into student representation and politics for some years. In 1979 he returned to postgraduate study at Queen Mary College, University of London, being awarded an MSc in Astrophysics in 1981.<br>\n你们谁的「个人感觉」比人家牛逼？（提示：Piers Corbyn 生于 1947 年）<br>\n然而：<br>\nCorbyn has stated his belief that the anthropogenic contribution to global warming is minimal with any increase in temperature due to increased solar activity. In 2008 Corbyn went even further than being sceptical, and took an absolutist, certain position by stating, &quot;CO2 has never driven, does not drive and never will drive weather or climate. Global warming is over and it never was anything to do with CO2. CO2 is still rising but the world is now cooling and will continue to do so.&quot;<br>\n（当然我也不认同他认为 the world is cooling 的结论。气候变化这种一变就是几百年的东西，拿几十年的数据来做预测简直就是瞎扯淡，而且你预测不了太阳要怎么变啊~）","date":"2019-09-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
