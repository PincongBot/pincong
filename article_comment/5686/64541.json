The carbon cycle budgets used symmetric plus/minus ranges explicitly defined as 90% confidence intervals, whereas the RF bar chart reported a ‘mid-range’ bar along with a<br>\nplus/minus range that was estimated largely on the spread of published values. The likelihood, or confidence interval, of the spread of published results was not given. These uncertainties were additionally modified by a declaration that the confidence of the RF being within the specified range was indicated by a stated confidence level that ranged from ‘high’ (greenhouse gases) to ‘very low’ (aerosols). Due to the difficulty in approving such a long draft in plenary, the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) became a short document with no figures and few numbers. The use of scientific uncertainty in the SPM was thus limited and similar to the FAR: a range in the mean surface temperature increase since 1900 was given as 0.3°C to 0.6°C with no explanation as to likelihood of this range. While the underlying report showed projected future warming for a range of different climate models, the Technical Summary focused on a central estimate.","date":"2019-09-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
