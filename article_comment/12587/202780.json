Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa. To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and <b>ZC45</b>) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs using suckling rats as an animal model.<br>\n...<br>\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers<br>\nAll amplicon sequences and the full genomes of ZXC21 and<b> ZC45</b> generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers <a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9udWNjb3JlL01HNzcyODQ0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MG772844</a> through <a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9udWNjb3JlL01HNzcyOTM0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MG772934</a>.<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n4.BLAST result of <i><b><a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wcm90ZWluLzE3OTEyNjkwOTI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">QHD43418.1</a></b></i><br>\n1: <a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly9ibGFzdC5uY2JpLm5sbS5uaWguZ292L0JsYXN0LmNnaSNhbG5IZHJfQVZQNzgwMzM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">envelope protein [Bat SARS-like coronavirus]&nbsp; </a>144 144 100% 2e-43 100.00% <i><b><a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wcm90ZWluL0FWUDc4MDMzLjE_cmVwb3J0PWdlbmJhbmsmbG9nJD1wcm90dG9wJmJsYXN0X3Jhbms9MSZSSUQ9MkJVWE5EWDYwMVI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AVP78033.1</a></b></i><br>\nFrom 2 to 100 are all E protain with identical percent&nbsp; 94.74% ~ 27.79%<br>\nLess than 27.79% not show.<br>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/VvX0CZV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VvX0CZV.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/VvX0CZV.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Host of bat-SL-CoV<b>ZC45 </b>is Rhinolophus sinicus (<a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvUmhpbm9sb3BodXNfc2luaWN1cw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese rufous horseshoe bat</a>).<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China studied bat-SL-CoV<b>ZC45 </b>in 2018 and published&nbsp;results with full genomes in the journal.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bats lie dormant in winter.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus is homo SARS virus.<br>\nPercent Identity 100%: Gene sequence of E protein in each of these viruses is same. <br>\n(https://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/walt/sepa/Activities/BLASTpractice.pdf):<br>\n<blockquote> - E value: The E value (expected value) is a number that describes how many times you would expect a match by chance in a database of that size.
