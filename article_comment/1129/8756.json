To put it simply, you are a huge heap of atoms, behaving in a certain way. If the existence of some thing changes the behavior of your atoms (this includes causing your neurons to fire differently, i.e. causing thoughts in your mind), that is, causing physical changes in you, how can you claim it is not physical?
