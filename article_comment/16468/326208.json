Well for me, you did not hurt my feeling, but I would have been hurt if someone said something like that to me. <br>\nUltimately, everyone can only control his/her own behavior. Don't worry about Mephisto, or anyone else. Like Carl said, take a break. <br>\nAlso, I want to apologize if I accidentally made the tension worse. That was not my intention. I will refrain from speaking on this subject. See, maybe I should take a break too. :)<br>\n<br>\nHopefully the next time I leave a comment, it is in one of your new posts, not related to this. <br>\nBest wishes to you.","date":"2020-03-31","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
