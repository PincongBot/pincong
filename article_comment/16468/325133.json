I can't send private messages, so I say what I can here to you. <br>\n<br>\nI am sorry for what happened. I love reading your work, and I hope you are still interested in sharing your thoughts and ideas. But at this moment, I feel it's best that you stay away from anything pincong-related, for a week, or longer. Real life is more important than anything else.","date":"2020-03-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
