Very kind of you.<br>\nIt's been a whole week of pincong politics. Sorry if any of you peaceful Alaskans felt disturbed.<br>\n<br>\nA few words about the things I said earlier:<br>\n- I do judge people a lot, but very rarely do I make mistakes. In the case of the user Mephisto, he really needs a doctor.<br>\n- I never accuse people of anything they didn't do (bottom line).<br>\n- I'm not interested in verbal fights. I'm more of a point-out-the-obvious kind of person. Certain people took it as offensive.<br>\n- I don't know the actual reason for my INSPECTING status. The only thing I know is that the owner of the site himself did it.<br>\n- The site owner is the only man I can't and never willing to fight against. Hence the immediate apology (even though I still don't know what he meant)","date":"2020-03-30","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
