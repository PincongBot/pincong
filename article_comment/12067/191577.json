Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a judge or a jury). The prosecution must in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted.”<br>\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence#Modern_practices","date":"2020-01-11","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
