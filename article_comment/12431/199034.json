Or a gas pipeline, similar to the one from Russia to Germany (which the US wants to stop now!)<br>\n<br>\n我: Haha, it's a pity that you can't read Chinese. There are a lot of Chinese lowlifes are threatening to wage war on us. Of course, it is not going to happen as China gov. is smarter than that. However, some called them \"Chinazi\" is not for nothing.<br>\n<br>\n德: I would closer bonds as a possible win-win scenario, together against the US. Eventually, Taiwan will have to make that decision anyway. And being a partner of the US would possibly guarantee a very insecure future in times of \"America first\". China doesn't need a war for that (and I don't believe it is in their interest) - time is their partner.<br>\n<br>\n細看一下可以看出德國人的態度","date":"2020-01-17","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
