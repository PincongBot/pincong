Back against the wall, we stand today directly against it. We believe it is our duty to call out to the world with the following message: face the threats of the CCP, or face a global-scale humanitarian crisis.<br>\n<br>\nThe seventy-year rule of the CCP over the nation of China is built on the blood of its own people. The regime consolidated its own power by mobilizing the people in a gigantic purge of dissidents that became known as the Cultural Revolution. It did the same by turning its military forces against progressively minded civilians, students and intellectuals in the Tiananmen Massacre. It continues to do so today by openly prosecuting human rights activists and lawyers with a legal system designed exclusively to serve the regime instead of the people. In China, the technologies that appear to benefit the people’s lives monitor and control these lives at the same time. The people’s devotion to their land and culture is surreptitiously turned into the devotion to this regime through an all-pervasive propaganda machine. The nationwide union of its diverse peoples over which it prides itself today masks the colonization and genocide of minority groups in Xinjiang and elsewhere. The CCP does not merely resemble a fascist regime - it is a fascist regime.<br>\n<br>\nAmong the many totalitarian regimes relying on nationalist propaganda throughout history, the CCP achieved unprecedented success by monopolizing the very concept of ‘China’. In so doing, it blackmails the Chinese people over the entire world into supporting its world-conquest and, when necessary, into becoming soldiers in a politico-economic war with other countries. <br>\n<br>\nAs the last fortress of freedom on Chinese territory, Hong Kong refuses to submit to a corrupt totalitarian regime which distorts its own history and which both silences its people and relies on the ugly nationalist sentiments that it plants among them. At this moment, the CCP is mobilizing all its forces to tear apart the unprotected line of defense which Hong Kong forms for the free world. When ‘the new West Berlin’ falls, it will arrive at the entrance to the heartland of the free world, an entrance into which it waited seventy years to break. <br>\n<br>\nThe rise of China under the rule of the CCP brings the world today close to a point of history, in the last century, where totalitarian regimes were steadily on their way to committing crimes against humanity. As fellow human beings, we have paid a heavy price for letting them become what they have become. Are we willing to learn from our own catastrophic past? Are we willing to turn a blind eye to the CCP’s oppression and massacre of its own people and to its growing dominion over global economy? Are we capable of sincerely believing that a totalitarian regime will, over the course of economic development, come to embrace the values of human rights, democracy and freedom to which we, members of the free world, hold dearly? As the CCP advances unrelentingly and as its economic hegemony feeds at this very second on the economies of other countries through its monstrous ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, we stand at the crossroad of history: can we stop evil before it becomes too powerful to fight off, or is a total war once again inevitable?<br>\n<br>\nWe Hongkongers believe in freedom and democracy, in universal values which traverse all races and groups of interest, and in the glorious light of human goodness. Here, we call for the free world to join us and stand as one against the greatest threat it has ever seen. History shall demand no less from a world which wishes to be free.","date":"2019-09-30","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
