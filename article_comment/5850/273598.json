In his book Ars Conjectandi (The Art of Conjecturing), published by his nephew Nicholas eight years after his death in 1713, Bernoulli showed that if the number of such trials were large, then the proportion of them that were successes would be close to p with a probability near 1. Jacques Bernoulli was from the first generation of the most famous mathematical family of all time. Altogether, there were between 8 and 12 Bernoullis, spread over three generations, who made fundamental contributions to probability, statistics, and mathematics. One difficulty in knowing their exact number is the fact that several had the same name. (For example, two of the sons of Jacques’s brother Jean Section 4.7 The Poisson Random Variable 143 were named Jacques and Jean.) Another difficulty is that several of the Bernoullis were known by different names in different places. Our Jacques (sometimes written Jaques) was, for instance, also known as Jakob (sometimes written Jacob) and as James Bernoulli. But whatever their number, their influence and output were prodigious. Like the Bachs of music, the Bernoullis of mathematics were a family for the ages!","date":"2020-02-29","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
