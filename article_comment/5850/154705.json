Only a baby can start. You and me--why, we're all that's been. The anger of a moment, the thousand pictures, that's us.  This land, this red land, is us; and the flood years and the dust years and the drought years are us. We can't start again. The bitterness we sold to the junk man--he got it all right, but we have it still. And when the owner men told us to go, that's us; and when the tractor hit the house, that's us until we're dead. To California or any place--every one a drum major leading a parade of hurts....And some day--the armies of bitterness will all be going the same way. And they'll all walk together, and there'll be a dead terror from it.<br>\n<br>\n原意的话，我由于还没有读过这本小说，所以还是不太清楚。。。<br>\n<br>\n但我根据原小说的梗概，大致推测一下：<br>\n<br>\n这句话的直译为“每个人都是鼓手，带着我们自己的痛苦前进，带领着伤痛游行。”这里为我认为前半句“Everyone's a drum major leading a parade of hurts”因该是指当时还有很多像主人公一样拖家带口在流浪的。“leading a parade of hurts”因该是带领着整个家庭（大概）。“marching with our own bitterness”里的“marching”意味着这些像主人公一样流浪的人们就是在进行着对大萧条时期的政府的抗议。“ with our own bitterness”则是在说每个人都因为各种各样的原因而颠沛流离。<br>\n<br>\n我不知道是否是正确的，但又一点我很清楚：以我有限的中英文水平，我翻译不出来。。。。","date":"2019-12-08","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
