She therefore called for campaigns aimed at travellers which give clear information about child labour in tourism and makes them aware of their responsibilities. She also felt it was important that those messages must be elaborated and adapted to specific local situations. <b>She encourages tourists to be vigilant and contact specialised NGO’s when they observe a child being exploited in a destination. She does not recommend tourists giving children money directly as it is not an efficient way of giving development assistance. </b></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n實際上要做到很難，當下真的會很於心不忍。但世界就是不完美的，愛與善並不能解決所有問題。","date":"2020-07-08","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
