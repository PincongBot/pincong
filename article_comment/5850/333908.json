An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based upon the work of others. It is a work created with a unique style and substance. The term \"originality\" is often applied as a compliment to the creativity of artists, writers, and thinkers.[citation needed] The modern idea of originality is tied to Romanticism, by a notion that is often called romantic originality.<br>\n<br>\nThe concept of originality is culturally contingent. At the time of Shakespeare, it was more common to appreciate the similarity with an admired classical work, and Shakespeare himself avoided \"unnecessary invention\".It wasn't until the start of the 18th century that the concept of originality became an ideal in Western culture.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n来自维基百科：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originality<br>\n<br>\n（参考：知识产权：https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/知识产权）","date":"2020-04-07","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
