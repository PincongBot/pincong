He told reporters it will not be “business as usual” with China once the pandemic ends.<br>\n<br>\nMr. Trudeau, pressed by reporters on Friday to say whether he felt the revised number of deaths from China was evidence Beijing had been covering up the full extent of the COVID-19 damage, declined to directly answer – and did not mention China.<br>\n<br>\n“We need to look carefully at the numbers that are shared by different countries around the world,” he told reporters in French. “Certainly … there will be conclusions to be drawn in the end regarding the behaviour of different countries, but for the moment, we must work together, collaborate and do everything we can to learn and better protect our citizens at home.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe Prime Minister was asked why he is reluctant to question China’s handling of the outbreak when politicians in other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and France, are doing so.<br>\n<br>\nHe said now is not the time for criticism but for international co-operation – and suggested one concern is ensuring Canadians get the protective equipment they need. Ottawa and the provinces are looking to China for medical supplies.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n原来搞半天，是为了PPE。。。<br>\n也难怪，前不久新闻才说政府在中国有了自己专属的供应商。我估计中南海有帮忙。<br>\n所以这个时候自然是要闭嘴的吧。<br>\n<br>\n算了，这个世界有的时候没办法非黑即白。性命攸关的时候，对错也来不及分了。","date":"2020-04-18","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
