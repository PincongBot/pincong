The Postal Service apparently had difficulty processing some of them correctly and, as a result, an unknown number of votes — perhaps thousands — may have been wrongfully disqualified because of a lack of a postmark.<br>\n<br>\nElection officials also said the changing plans for the state’s presidential primary — it was initially canceled before being reinstated by the courts — had delayed the process of sending out absentee ballots.<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n總結起來就是初選本來是要取消，後來法庭說不取消，然後匆忙之下又有比預期多的多的人選擇mail-in。偏偏USPS也沒經驗，NY是去年1月才合法的，第一次不說，又撞上疫情。<br>\n<br>\n總之在外人看來，真是一片慘不忍睹的混亂。不過呢，這算不上fraud，我覺得有這一波教訓也挺好，New York State應該要知道川川的小眼神死死盯著令人討厭的他們，11月有什麼狀況一定會被拿來說嘴，提早準備好可能會遇到的問題，到時候才會順利舉行選舉。","date":"2020-08-05","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
