Since that all lives matter isn't universally accepted/remembered, to stress fervently that some particular lives matter is dangerous, and methinks, the word Also is better added to serve as a constant reminder. People, if unreminded, unfortunately ignore numerous simple principles. Indeed the ability for self reflection is crucial. Yet so is how to, or the more one thinks, the wronger he may go. Blood is not washed with blood, but with water. The question of employers matter and the like is to be explained with people's forgetfulnesss as well. Many things are apparent, but if unreminded of, would be sadly ignored by many, and cause irreversible damages. Not most people inherently see the two sides of the story and know which part is to adjust for the moment and how much. Even many of the Chinese commies' claims are true. Yet precisely because of their being true, partial truths are even more misleading, and so audi alteram partem. I hope my simultaneous response is not incomprehenisble, and I sincerely wish you health and prosperity.","date":"2020-06-25","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
