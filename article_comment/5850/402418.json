There is a small but growing population (at least 43 bears[15]) in the Pyrenees, on the border between Spain and France, which was once on the edge of extinction,[16] as well as two subpopulations in the Cantabrian Mountains in Spain (amounting to around 250 individuals[17]). There are also populations totalling around one hundred bears in the Abruzzo, South Tyrol and Trentino regions of Italy.</blockquote>","date":"2020-06-03","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
