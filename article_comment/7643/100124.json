I didn't call you a wumao, I was pointing out in my previous comment that your source of info is shit. MischaEDM has a history of running wild with far-fetched stories, from conspiracy theories about the disappearance of MH370 to Philipp Rösler being some CCP big cheese's illegitimate son, all stretching credulity to the limit. When a somewhat reputable source such as the NYT breaks a story like the one about Elaine Chao's CCP connections, it backs it up with strong evidence in the form of page after page of verified documents, so you know it's not some overzealous journalist gunning for Pulitzer making shit up. MischaEDM and her ant army comrades by contrast forcibly connect dubious dots to confirm their pre-existing beliefs often formed after Guo has dropped them a &quot;hint&quot;. See the difference? And the fact they mostly target Asians tells me they have an axe to grind. I have taken it upon myself to inform others about the danger of falling into their consipracy rabbit hole. So if it's a Guo thread, expect me to butt in with a few words. It's your prerogative to choose to believe these people are on the inside track of these things, just be prepared to be laughed at. Honestly I'm tired of arguing with retards. Calling me a wumao won't make you any less of a retard, but fine, call me a wumao if that's the best you've got, I couldn't care less.","date":"2019-11-07","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
