This afternoon, something distressing happened to me.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the November 13th's 'Conceptualising Landscape' seminar, a Chinese student mentioned the unique landscape within China's tibet. The lecturer Ian Thompson however taunted in response, stating &quot;O Tibet, you should know that most westerners do not consider Tibet to be a part of China'.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't felt this disrespected for since my 2 months of leaving China. I'm requesting advice from fellow experts on Douban (A major Chinese social media), what should I do? Should I send a complaint email to the school? But he is my course leader, I don't know whether this will affect my grades.&quot;","date":"2019-11-18","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
