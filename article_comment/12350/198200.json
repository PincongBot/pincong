I dont think so.  in terms of tones, that hyper sensitive dude who used very few &quot;good&quot; books in certain area to compare with the overwhelming advantage of books written in english in computer science, just so to prove chinese is no worse, had worse tones, why didnt you lecture him on his tones instead of mine?  and let me tell you, it is called sarcasm calling chinese brainwashed with a fragile ego when I am chinese too, just like that nigger thing between black folks, goodbye.","date":"2020-01-16","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
