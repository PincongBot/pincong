And thats why people using certain languages are better at certain subject disciplines than others. Of course assholes extremely good at chinese are the most evil deceitful politicians on planet earth, like Pig Pooh the Xi.<br>\n<br>\n2.English is the language of scientific research, tell me how you are gona get deep in any modern science area without an excellent grasp of the english language. All for the simple purpose of gathering informantion, there is absolutely no point in discussing whether the chinese language carries more information than other language structurally, cuz language is for the seek of communicating aka exchanging info.<br>\n<br>\n3.what is the fucking point in comparing which length of new words in each language is better? the english world is the fastest expanding world, which means most new concepts would first be created in english, then translated into other languages.<br>\n<br>\n4.most people here have already in their life had enough traditional chinese culture exposure, which in my opinion its a overdose.&nbsp; Shakespear would be so pissed off knowing the rude commet of that asshole above me. <br>\n<br>\n5.Be honest to youself. Most chinese ARE stupid and TOXIC, including the stupid motherfucking elitist government officials, and they are creating a even stupider environment which harbors anger, stupidity, ignorance, shamelessness, and a whole population of&nbsp; unhappy psychopaths, would you like to be part of them?","date":"2020-01-15","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
