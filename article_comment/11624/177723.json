Points it at two men standing in the back of the congregation. It appears one tries to draw a gun himself in defense, he’s slow, and he’s shot by the perp. Perp then shoots other guy standing, then swings to shoot at more people. An older guy from half way across the room, probably 30-40yds away, draws and fires one round and hits the perp in the head turning him off like a damn light switch. Total time from first shot to the perp dead is maybe 3 seconds at most. After, 6 or so more members of the congregation draw guns and run over to make sure the perp is down while others attend to the wounded.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>兇手在教堂崇拜時突然站起來，拔出霰彈槍，看上去像是500戰術，沒有槍托或折疊槍托。將其指向站在會眾後面的兩個人。看來有人企圖拔槍自衛，但他動作緩慢，被兇手擊中。然後，兇手射擊另一個站著的人，然後亂槍向更多人射擊。一個來自教堂中間的大個子，大概在30至40碼遠處，拔槍並開了一槍，擊中了兇手腦袋，使他像閉關該死的電燈開關一樣立即擊殺。從兇手射擊到被擊斃的總時間最多為3秒。之後，會眾中約有六名或更多的成員拔槍並跑過去，以確保兇手被繳械，而其他人則受傷。</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Older man is a a fucking hero. Absolute clutch draw and shoot. I shoot a lot and I’m really unsure I could draw that quick and make one single head shot from 30+ yds under pressure like that. Practice your draw and shooting, people.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>那個長者真是他媽的英雄。絕對的戰術式拔槍射擊。我開了很多槍，我真的不確定我能不能很快做出這樣的戰術動作，並在這樣的壓力下用30餘碼打出一個爆頭。人們啊，練習練習你們的戰術拔槍和射擊術。</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>This would have been a fucking massacre if that church didn’t have armed men in it. This wasn’t some personal dispute, this guy obviously intended to shoot randomly and as many as possible. Which is why this won’t get any coverage.<br>\n<br>\n如果那個教堂沒有武裝人員，那將是一場他媽的大屠殺。這不是個人糾紛，這傢伙顯然打算隨意射擊並儘可能多地殺人。這就是為什麼（建制派媒體）不會對此進行任何報導的原因。</b></blockquote>","date":"2019-12-31","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
