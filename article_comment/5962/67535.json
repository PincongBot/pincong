Here are three reasons: 1) The basic law is unconstitutional because it passed no referendum or vote by a fairly elected local legislature.2) Hong Kong was taken over by a diplomatic process which violated the former British colony's right to self-determination. 3) China allows no other form of loyalty but obedience to its unlawful regime which is not authorized by the people but empowered by its own guns.<br>\nQuote Tweet","date":"2019-10-04","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
