China is probably the worst in terms of the quality of air</b>,” Djokovic said in the post-match press conference at the ATP Cup 2020 on Saturday.<br>\n<br>\n<i>“It’s tough for them (Australian Open organisers) because scheduling has to be respected in terms of play. The Australian Open starts at a certain time. So there’s a lot of different things involved. But health concern is a health concern for me and for anybody,”</i>&nbsp;the 16-time Grand Slam champion admitted.</blockquote><br>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9CVkb0Q.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9CVkb0Q.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/9CVkb0Q.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a>","date":"2020-01-12","agreeCount":8,"discussionCount":0}
