Most travelers will in this case not need a visa, as they will not cross the external Schengen border. <br>\n<br>\nTravelers who arrive at Oslo airport for transit only, have to be aware that the transit area at the airport is closed between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. every day. If your arrival and the time of departure of your connecting flight makes it necessary to stay at the airport between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., you cannot use the transit area as it is closed during this time. All travelers will then have to pass the border control in order to stay at the airport’s non-transit area or a nearby hotel. This means that those nationals, who must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external Schengen border according to Annex 1 of the Visa Handbook, may need a Schengen visa even if they are only transiting Schengen in Norway. In addition, persons who need to check out and check in their luggage at the airport (normally when using different airlines) also have to go through the border control, even if they are only transiting. Check your luggage tag to see if this applies to you.","date":"2020-07-28","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
