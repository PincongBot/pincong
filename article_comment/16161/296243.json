EX: The school teacher has taught in 2 public schools and 1 private school, to date. (Yes, \"to date\" can be used ANYWHERE in a sentence - as an adverbial.) However, \"so far\" is used for on-going actions, thoughts, ideas; think of it like saying that you know something now but expect a change soon. EX: We're baking cookies for the show tonight and, so far, we have 12 cookies done; in 2 more minutes, we'll have 24.</blockquote>","date":"2020-03-14","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
