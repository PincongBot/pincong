Here and there,<br>\nsome detail might be improved. The practical application of the principles will depend, as the<br>\nManifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being<br>\nexisting, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at<br>\nthe end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. In<br>\nview of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the accompanying improved<br>\nand extended organization of the working class, in view of the practical experience gained, first in<br>\nthe February Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the<br>\nfirst time held political power for two whole months, this programme has in some details been<br>\nantiquated. One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that “the working class<br>\ncannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.”<br>\n(See The Civil War in France: Address of the General Council of the International Working<br>\nMen’s Association, 1871, where this point is further developed.) Further, it is self-evident that the<br>\ncriticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time, because it comes down<br>\nonly to 1847; also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition<br>\nparties (Section IV), although, in principle still correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the<br>\npolitical situation has been entirely changed, and the progress of history has swept from off the<br>\nearth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated.<br>\nBut then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to<br>\nalter. A subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847<br>\nto the present day; but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that.<br>\nKarl Marx &amp; Frederick Engels<br>\nJune 24, 1872, London <br>\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf","date":"2019-12-31","agreeCount":8,"discussionCount":0}
