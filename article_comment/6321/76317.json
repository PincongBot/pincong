He's been following the Rockets since Yao Ming was at his prime, for about a dozen years. I told him about Morey's Tweet, but he didn't give a shit at all. He even added: what their manager said wasn't the Rockets' business and he would always be their fan. I flipped out right away, arguing with him all morning. Now I'm severing all ties with that old bastard and I won't come back if he doesn't apologize. The country is more important that family, or anything else for that matter. I ain't got no more to say. Alas, boy am I upset at the end of our holidays. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n(This is NOT trolling. Shit's fucking real)","date":"2019-10-10","agreeCount":6,"discussionCount":0}
