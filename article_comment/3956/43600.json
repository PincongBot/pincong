I know you are the busiest man in the world, I will be very grateful if you can send someone to check the issue. I hope this is not a cyber attack, because I recall the web site was in a status of \"Site Unavailable\" for few hours on 24 Aug. <br>\n<br>\nHere is the link of my petition:<br>\nhttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/demand-chinese-government-remove-great-firewall-restriction<br>\n<br>\nAnd here is the link of another petition in same situation that I mentioned:<br>\nhttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/we-demand-rejection-andy-tsangs-nomination-united-nations-positions<br>\n<br>\nThank you very much for your time.<br>\nDon<br>\n<br>\n有回復我會放上來。","date":"2019-08-25","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
