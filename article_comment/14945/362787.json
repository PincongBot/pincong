Neoconservatives generally support economic liberalization, austerity, and tend to support a hawkish foreign policy, a leftover of their historical animosity for the Soviet Union. Socially, they tend to be socially conservative, opposing same-sex marriage, abortion, and other social advances advocated by those in opposition to conservatism. However, they tend to support secularism, likely because of their 20th century American origins, but they can be described as being culturally Christian. Neoconservatives are most prominent in the US, where their support for Wilsonianism, a viewpoint that espouses making the world safe for democracy, has led to the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n64%<br>\nMarket Liberalism<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n60%<br>\nSocial Liberal<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n52%<br>\nChristian Democrat<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n52%<br>\nAnarchist<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n44%<br>\nSocial Democrat<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n30%<br>\nPaleoconservative<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n28%<br>\nMarxist Communist<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n2%<br>\nFascist<br>\n0%<br>\nAuthoritarian Socialist","date":"2020-04-30","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
