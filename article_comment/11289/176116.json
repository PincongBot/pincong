Guilty as charged lol<br>\n<br>\nTo put not too fine a point, all modern scholars in the circle of academic establishment are his spiritual twins, more bureacrats than truth seekers, therefore it is no wonder really, that their products, I don't call those students or pupils, cannot truely fit for reality.<br>\n<br>\nLanguage acquisition in the modern education system is a black humor that already has lasted for more than a century. In fact, learning about a language, grammar, syntax, cultural bits, linguistic pieces, etc., is NOT acquiring a language, to speak, write, read, and think in it, and bureacrat scholars simply cannot see the difference or won't, for they could benefit from such a huge system, almost forever.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as a consequence of hundreds of years effort we see one product of their construction, alias southpark2, defending with outrage a system, and a mind sham, that really does nothing but wastes his own precious time and destroys himself in the sense of language potential.<br>\n<br>\nWhat a perfect world for corruption when you can get so willing subjects!","date":"2019-12-29","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
