Trump's regime cannot be called an \"administration\" for they administer nothing other than lies, fraud and hatred. America will never be strong again until it first brings to justice Trump and Senate for their dereliction of duty; their policies of ripping brown babies from their mothers at the border; their murderous mismanagement of Covid-19; and their grotesque levels of theft, corruption and abuse of power apparent to everyone. This includes Bannon's rampant misappropriation of funds for \"The Wall\". Bannon should go to prison. Dispensing justice will require a hard and direct response to Trump's corruption, and traitorous acts. These are immense evils. Whatever may be left of our devastated democracy, it absolutely cannot afford to be compromising, tentative, timid, circumspect, cautious, or narrow.&nbsp;We need to fight hard. No more hand-wringing. We can learn something from the thugs: their gloves already came off long ago, but we're still playing nice; they have zero agenda besides holding on to power and money, but we're still pretending to reason with them, and even worse: pacify them! Send conman Bannon to jail and make him pay every penny he stole, plus penalties and fines. That's a start. oz.","date":"2020-08-20","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
