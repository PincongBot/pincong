Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa. To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and <b><u>ZC45</u></b>) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs using suckling rats as an animal model.<br>\n...<br>\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers<br>\nAll amplicon sequences and the full genomes of ZXC21 and<b> <u>ZC45</u></b> generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MG772844\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MG772844</a> through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MG772934\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MG772934</a>.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n4.BLAST result of <i><b><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/1791269092\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">QHD43418.1</a></b></i><br>\n1: <a href=\"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi#alnHdr_AVP78033\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">envelope protein [Bat SARS-like coronavirus]&nbsp; </a>144 144 100% 2e-43 100.00% <i><b><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AVP78033.1?report=genbank&amp;log$=prottop&amp;blast_rank=1&amp;RID=2BUXNDX601R\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AVP78033.1</a></b></i><br>\nFrom 2 to 100 are all E protain with score 94.74% ~ 27.79%<br>\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VvX0CZV.png<br>\n<br>\n5.
