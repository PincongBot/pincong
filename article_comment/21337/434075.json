Direct flights between China and Australia have significantly reduced. If despite our advice you travel to China, you’ll be subject to 14 days mandatory quarantine. Quarantine requirements may change at short notice. If you’re already in China, and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means. Authorities have detained foreigners because they're 'endangering national security'. Australians may also be at risk of arbitrary detention.<br>\nWe haven't changed our level of advice.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained#level4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Do not travel</a> to China.<br>\n</blockquote>","date":"2020-07-08","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
