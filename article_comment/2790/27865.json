Than means he's understanding in sociology, psychology, and other subjects concerning human instead of matter will echo those in STEM. So, he and you share the same strand of &quot;thought germs&quot;. If you truly wish to become more sophisticated in these kind of discussions, I'd recommend (you, and anyone, frankly,) reading old style books as opposed to contenting yourself with YouTube videos.<br>\n<br>\n（因为题主给了小灰的视频和英文描述，但是没有给出中文，我预设楼主更愿意用英文讨论了。给英文不灵光的朋友们鞠躬致歉。）","date":"2019-08-04","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
