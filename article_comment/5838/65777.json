That speed, and its use of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, a technology known as MIRV, to deliver its warheads makes it far more difficult to detect and intercept.<br>\nIt also flies at a much lower altitude just prior to delivering its warhead, further frustrating attempts to detect and intercept.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n被shock到的是更猛的DF-41，但这个我觉得可能吹牛的成分更高一点？(但wiki说99年就模拟成功了。。。)<br>\n<blockquote> The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in Washington says the missile may have the world’s longest range at 15,000 kilometers (9,400 miles). Flying at 25 times the speed of sound, it might be able to reach the United States in 30 minutes and send up to 10 warheads to separate targets using MIRV technology.</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n25倍音速低空飞行，射程15000公里，美国本土30分钟到达。<br>\n<br>\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/东风-41型洲际弹道导弹","date":"2019-10-02","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
