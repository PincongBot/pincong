I understand that this bank does have some challenges, but it’s one of the few that will allow you to open an account without a Social Security number.<br>\n<br>\nIf you decide to travel to the US to open an account at Wells Fargo, I personally recommend using the Miami or Las Vegas branches. Both are accustomed to dealing with non-US residents, and neither require an SSN to open an account.","date":"2019-12-21","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
