According to the Constitution of China and the practice of government administration, both the National people's Congress and the Chinese people's political Consultative Conference meet once a year to decide on important government affairs. But because China is a one-party autocratic country, the National people's Congress and the Chinese people's political Consultative Conference are more likely to be the rubber stamps of the Communist Party.","date":"2020-03-02","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
