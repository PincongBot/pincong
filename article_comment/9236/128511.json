After all, They came here to be educated, didn't they?<br>\n<br>\nFor the past few months, Hong Kong demonstrators (mainly students) had been brutally abused by the police.<br>\nThey were shot, raped and tortured.<br>\nOver 2500 Dead bodies are discovered, scattered around this dying city.<br>\n<br>\n(大学全名) should call on all students to stand with Hong Kong and organize activities to support Hong Kong demonstrators and condemn on the police violence. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, please feel free to make this email public and share it around.<br>\n<br>\nThere is a saying,<br>\n<i>Its always darkest before the dawn.</i><br>\n<br>\n<b>If so, we shall be the lights.</b><br>\n<b>What say you?</b><br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\n<br>\nA True Chinese who will continue to stand with Hong Kong.","date":"2019-11-23","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
