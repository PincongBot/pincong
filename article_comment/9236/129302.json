Having myself been involved in the sensitive issue of geopolitics and university autonomy (in terms of this case, standing with TU Berlin and supporting Hong Kongers), as a college student from China mainland, I certainly understand that it can be a tough decision.<br>\n<br>\nThe Chinese nationalists cheer for the attacks on the CUHK and PolyU by Hong Kong police who threw more than 2,000 tear gas bombs at the campuses and arrested around 1000 students.<br>\n<br>\nThese Chinese nationalists call the Hong Kong protesters “cockroaches\", and claim that they deserve to be beaten, arrested and even be killed by the politics with no mercy. <br>\n<br>\nAs a supporter of democracy, and believing in the importance of upholding free speech, I would argue that a line should be drawn, when someone who enjoys the freedom of speech in Germany is involved in acts of oppression of other people. Especially many of the victims are young college students (such as those from CUHK and PolyU) who protect their own campuses and fight for their entitled human rights.<br>\n<br>\nI hesitate to interfere in the affairs of your university. However, as a college student and supporter of human rights, I feel no choice but to write to you asking your student committee to consider supporting Hong Kong students. <br>\n<br>\nBest regards,<br>\n<br>\nxxxxx","date":"2019-11-24","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
