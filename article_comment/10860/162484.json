Traveling to one point, they find a town where all the ponies have the same cutie mark, an equal sign. The friends suspect something is wrong with the townfolk, particularly after meeting their leader, Starlight Glimmer. Starlight shows that all the ponies living there have given up their cutie marks and special talents, as they believe that they can achieve true friendship by being of equal skill. Twilight and her friends secretly meet with other ponies who desire their cutie marks again, and travel to a vault where the marks are kept. Upon arrival, the six are lured into a trap and Starlight is able to take their marks.<br>\n<br>\nS5E2<br>\nWithout their cutie marks, the six friends are trapped in the village while Starlight Glimmer waits for them to accept their fate. The friends send Fluttershy, who has been the most open to the townspeople, to act as though she has accepted Starlight's ways in order to help the others escape. That night, Fluttershy sneaks out and discovers that Starlight never gave up her cutie mark, using makeup to mask her real one. When Starlight frees the others the next day, Fluttershy exposes Starlight's ruse to the townsfolk by splashing water on her. As Starlight flees with the six's marks, the townsfolk reclaim their own marks and chase Starlight down, successfully recovering the six marks. Starlight manages to escape, while everyone returns to the town to celebrate getting their individuality back.</blockquote>","date":"2019-12-13","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
