Both these diseases display highly distinctive patterns of sudden emergence and global spread, which are not easy to understand by conventional epidemiological analysis based on simple infection-driven human- to-human spread of an infectious disease (assumed to jump suddenly and thus genetically, from an animal reservoir). Both these enigmatic diseases make sense however under a Panspermia in-fall model and the evidence consistent with such a model is critically reviewed.<br>\n<br>\n七个作者，一个来自天津疾控中心<br>\n<br>\n通讯作者Chandra Wickramasinghe一直坚持他的理论，某些病毒可能是从太空中来的。自非典时期应该快20年了","date":"2020-09-12","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
