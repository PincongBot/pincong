Dozens of students were injured. Doctors and first-aiders were not allowed to help the injured students and even got arrested (<a href=\"https://pincong.rocks/url/link/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9qb3NodWF3b25nY2Yvc3RhdHVzLzExOTYzOTY4MTU3MjcyODQyMjQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1196396815727284224</a>).
