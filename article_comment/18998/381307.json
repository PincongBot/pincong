Are mass graves buried, or are crematoria burning down? Such a huge amount of concurrency is more than the US can handle. If the mass graves had been buried, digging them to bury so many people, they would have been exposed long ago. It's kind of hard to bury millions of bodies without anyone noticing when a manhole is sneaking around and burying tens of thousands.<br>\n<br>\nWhat about all those bodies, how they were disposed of, and where exactly they went? The very likely speculation is that the United States took these carcasses, made them into frozen meat, and served them as pork pork, or some other kind of meat, or processed mature meat, or made adult meat hamburgers, human hot dogs, and gave them to other Americans to eat. Now a lot of the pork plants, the dairies, in America are bankrupt. <b>Eating human flesh can solve both the problem of food shortages in the economic crisis and the problem of disposing of dead bodies, so it can be a win-win situation.</b>","date":"2020-05-17","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
