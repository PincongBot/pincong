The premise is that men's underwear are a necessity in normal economic times and sales remain stable. During a severe downturn, demand for these goods changes as new purchases are deferred.[1] Hence, men's purchasing habits for underwear (and that of their spouses on their behalf) is thought to be a good indicator of discretionary spending for consumption at large especially during turnaround periods.<br>\n<br>\nThis indicator is noted for being followed by former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.[2]<br>\n<br>\nSee also<br>\nBig Mac index<br>\nHemline index<br>\n<br>\nReferences<br>\n<br>\n1.^ Mui, Ylan Q.

In good economies, we get such results as miniskirts (as seen in the 1920s and the 1960s),[3] or in poor economic times, as shown by the 1929 Wall Street Crash, hems can drop almost overnight. Non-peer-reviewed research in 2010 supported the correlation, suggesting that \"the economic cycle leads the hemline with about three years\".[4]<br>\n<br>\nDesmond Morris revisited the theory in his book Manwatching.<br>\n<br>\nSee also<br>\nMen's underwear index<br>\n<br>\nReferences<br>\n<br>\n1.^ Tamar Lewin, The hemline index, updated, International Herald Tribune, October 19, 2008 <br>\n2.^ See also Henrietta Prast \"Fashionomics\", Wilmott Magazine, June 2005, who cites Paul Nystrom in his 1928 monograph, The Economics of Fashion as the source of the theory. <br>\n3.^ Claire Brayford, \"The Hemline Economy\", Daily Express, February 13, 2008 <br>\n4.^ Marjolein van Baardwijk, Philip Hans Franses (2010). \"The hemline and the economy: is there any match?\" (PDF). publishing.eur.nl.
