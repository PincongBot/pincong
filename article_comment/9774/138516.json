If the goal is to prevent the Party from corroding human rights and civil liberties across the globe, this action by the US is surely insufficient. I advise that Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, liberal Western countries and Israel cooperate in areas of intelligence to counteract Party actions that corrode human rights and civil liberties internationally.","date":"2019-11-28","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
