At left is a People's Court with Chinese Landlord farmer Huang Chin-Chi, arms bound and on a leash, kneeling before it with an armed guard at his back. Owner of two--thirds of an acre - A comfortable building lot by American standards - Huang was condemned to death on charges he exploited the peasants. At right, execution of the sentence, Huang kneels on the sandy soil awaiting the fatal bullet in his back. He didn't have long to wait.","date":"2019-08-14","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
