At left is a People's Court with Chinese Landlord farmer Huang Chin-Chi, arms bound and on a leash, kneeling before it with an armed guard at his back. Owner of two--thirds of an acre - A comfortable building lot by American standards - Huang was condemned to death on charges he exploited the peasants.
