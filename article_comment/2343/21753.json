Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how........it is done. These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements! 这是target民主党这几个女性的。这里容不下左么？很奇怪诶，左又不一定全是开放边境只是呼吁平等，公平的机会然后尽量做好背景调查。中间偏左的政党在西方的年轻人中支持率向来很高，偏右一般是baby boomer当然你可以说好多右翼上台了但也希望说明不了左是坏的，权力需要平衡左所倡导的东西也是中国现在需要的，你说习近平大撒币那不是左右的问题了，那是金钱外交。。。","date":"2019-07-15","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
