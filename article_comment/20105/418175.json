I've personally read a lot of JP's stuff, in my opinion, one big focus he really wants to convey is the awakening of true individualism. Some of his words were like: I believe that the individual is the locus of salvation and redemption. / The answer to the problem of humanity is the integrity of the individual / You can't have individual Sovereignty without fundamental axioms.
