Newsrooms included were Annenberg Media, Ball State Daily News, Casper Star-Tribune, Cincinnati Enquirer, Coloradoan, Columbia Missourian, Dallas Morning News, Denver Post, Evergrey, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fresno Bee, Jacksboro, Herald-Gazette, Kansas City Star, KUT, Lima News, Minneapolis Star Tribune, NBC, Ogden Standard-Examiner, Rains County Leader, San Angelo Standard-Times, Skagit Publishing, Springfield News-Leader, St. Louis Magazine, St. Louis Public Radio, Steamboat Pilot &amp; Today, USA TODAY, WCPO, and WDET. Participation was strictly voluntary—no compensation was provided. Most newsrooms made reference to the survey on their websites and social media accounts. Some mentioned it in print and on air. For the most part, the survey was made available by newsrooms around the same time. However, the duration and level of participation did vary, as will be addressed below.<br>\n<br>\n从上面这段可以看出，这是一个针对普通网友的”民调“，所得出的结果只代表这些受访用户的意见，不等于该媒体的内容真实度。所以媒体得分来源于价值观类似，或者长期订阅观看的用户(众所周知，目前中天是除央视外可信度几乎最低的华语主流媒体。如果让台湾中天的忠实观众/读者们参与类似民调，他们一定把票都投给中天，甚至会超过很多相对可信度更高一些的媒体。这是否意味着中天的可信度高过这些被它超过的媒体呢？)<br>\n<br>\nPS:我个人认为，这个调查与其说是媒体可信度调查，不如说是各大媒体用户数量以及价值观/兴趣取向的调查","date":"2019-08-06","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
