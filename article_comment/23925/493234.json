I know her title. I know the company she&nbsp;works&nbsp;for. I’ve met a lot of her coworkers. I’ve seen her office.<br>\n<br>\nI am not a stupid man. She and I both have master’s degrees from the same university. Yet it’s only now, as I’ve been able to see her&nbsp;work&nbsp;firsthand, that I’m finally starting to understand what she does for a living.<br>\n<br>\nIt’s easy to understand what I do for a living. Just saying my job title will help about 99% of the population know exactly what I do. I’m an English teacher. See? No further explanation required.<br>\n<br>\nMy&nbsp;wife&nbsp;is a “project manager.” What the hell does that even mean? Has this project she’s been managing lasted 15 years? Aren’t most people who&nbsp;work&nbsp;managing a project of some sort or another? I mean, a cashier can also be described as a “project manager,” no? They’re managing the project of collecting payments from people. To a simple guy like me, “project manager” has a “meaningless corporate jargon” vibe to it.“<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n说白了，作为教师，他是直接参与生产（对学生照本宣科），而他老婆的工作则是中间件，不直接接触生产。","date":"2020-09-09","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
