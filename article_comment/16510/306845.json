The use of names such as ‘swine flu’ and ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors,” says Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General for Health Security, WHO. “This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected. We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods.”<br>\n这是WHO的原文，我是支持WHO的这个观点的。”这种地域命名会造成对某些群体的伤害，影响旅游与经济，而且会导致对牲畜的屠杀（？牲畜这块我也没理解）“","date":"2020-03-20","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
