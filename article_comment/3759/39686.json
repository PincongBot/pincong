Penalties typically include fines, imprisonment in county jail, or both. In addition, a person convicted of vandalism is frequently ordered to wash, repair or replace the damaged property (known as &quot;restitution&quot;), and/or participate in programs to clean up graffiti and other forms of vandalism.
