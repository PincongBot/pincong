If 5 accounts doesn’t make a change in the number beyond the range, I try 10 accounts. If 10 doesn’t work, I’ll try 20, and so on. As long as I have enough accounts to like, I will eventually know the number of accounts needed to make a significant change over the range you set, regardless of your rules.","date":"2019-04-26","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
