It only supports manual bridge configuration (inputting bridges you acquired from trustworthy sources) and manual proxy settings (configuring http/https/socks4/socks5 proxy,) both of which under most circumstances won't work for mainland users.<br>\n<br>\nThe bridges one can obtain from Tor's official bridge site are mostly blocked by the Great Firewall, and as for private tor bridges, well it's private thus moiling to obtain for the public. And the other option, proxies, is not that applicable for mainlanders also. Though it is possible to find tons of infos of proxy servers (their proxy type, IP, and connection port) online, most proxy servers are blocked and won't work in mainland China and the rest of the few lucky newly ones that haven't been blocked by the GFW will be in several days after its first public release.<br>\n<br>\nSo it's literally arduous to configure Tails OS for regular mainlanders, but not unrealizable. It take efforts to find functional bridges and proxy servers (I'd recommend the latter in this case as it is easier to find a proxy server functional in mainland.)","date":"2020-05-19","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
