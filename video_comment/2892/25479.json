Because we already had too much.<br>\n<br>\nNo matter how the director might have wanted to say something different, the ultimate objective of such kind a work, based on an anti-Japanese history and under the current censorship system, is always to express and empower patriotism.<br>\n<br>\nDoes patriotism matter? Of course. Every nation needs that. But patriotism against foreign nations is meaningless if no reflections can be made on our own nation. If we can have some movies on the cultural revolution, movies like this, or even Wolf Warrior, might be more meaningful as they represent different standpoints of view. However, if we are only focused on how we were bullied in history &amp; how we fought back, instead of revealing problems occurred within our own nation, it simply does not make any sense.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n(sorry that I'm unable to type Chinese with my current device)","date":"2020-08-25","agreeCount":5,"discussionCount":0}
