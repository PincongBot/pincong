Well.. <br>\n<br>\nWe fired our guns, and the British kept a-coming <br>\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. <br>\nWe fired once more and they began to running, <br>\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. <br>\n<br>\nWell they ran through the briars, and they ran through the brambles <br>\nAnd they ran through the bushes where a rabbit wouldn't go. <br>\nThey ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em <br>\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. <br>\n<br>\nWe fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down <br>\nSo we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. <br>\nWe filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind, <br>\nAnd when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind. <br>\n<br>\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-coming <br>\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. <br>\nWe fired once more and they began to running, <br>\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. <br>\n<br>\nWell they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles <br>\nAnd they ran through the bushes where a rabbit wouldn't go. <br>\nThey ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em <br>\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. <br>\n<br>\nhup, two, three, four. <br>\nsound, off, three, four. <br>\nhup, two, three, four. <br>\n<br>\nAugust 17, 2009: No alligators were harmed in the filming of this video.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n補充，我最喜歡的美國歌：God Bless the USA <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q65KZIqay4E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q65KZIqay4E</a>","date":"2020-02-14","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
