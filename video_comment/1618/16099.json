Type less and find more with Firefox's revamped address bar:<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Focused, clean search experience that's optimized for smaller laptop screens<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Top sites now appear when you select the address<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Improved readability of search suggestions with a focus on new search terms<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suggestions include solutions to common Firefox issues<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Linux, the behavior when clicking on the Address Bar and the Search Bar now matches other desktop platforms: a single click selects all without primary selection, a double click selects a word, and a triple click selects all with primary selection</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n地址栏在输入模式下会放大，可谓近年来Firefox唯一照顾我们老年用户使用体验的改动，颇有一种上网冲浪的旧时气息。现在的界面设计都喜欢劈头盖脸砸你一堆按钮，勾引用户不小心点进去制造PV。像我这样老掉牙的键盘侠，从刚上网的时候就习惯了直接记忆网址，从不搜索跳转也不喜欢从收藏夹打开，已经很不受这些新软件的欢迎了。","date":"2020-04-17","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
