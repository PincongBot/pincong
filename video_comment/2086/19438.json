You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.<br>\n<br>\nOne of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"<br>\n<br>\n這是原文，他完全沒提到肺炎是個hoax. 你看現代是多麼妙？現代資訊時代，卻是中共變得最厲害時代。當受過西方教育的左左人都為了政治利益而故意搞錯，你可以想像到擅長假情報新聞的中共是如何的如魚得水。<br>\n<br>\n當然，你如果說，川普不應該講可能性，應該莊重點，應該像個總統。我跟你說，你說得全對了。但一個人做壞就指出他做壞的地方，而不是創造另一個罪名。這叫做誠實，也應該是傳媒的底線。","date":"2020-05-21","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
