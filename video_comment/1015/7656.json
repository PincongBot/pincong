Once everything is gone, people can see other safely anyway.<br>\nNow I need to give a brief introduction on the medical supplies as well as organization structure of Wuhan city and Hubei province. In fact, we the medical team, on behave of the hospitals,are seeking public donations of medical supplies through the social media, because the entire public health system of Wuhan and Hubei Province has in a sense been abandoned by the government officials who were supposed to take charge of the current situation where very basic medical supplies such as bio hazard suite for doctors and nurses are in HUGE demand, for example, the specialized protection glasses I'm wearing right now, the masks, the surgical gloves, the bio suite, all these are VERY VERY needed. <br>\nWe the medical teams, the doctors and nurses, are exhaustively working in shifts and extremely overworked on the front line(fighting the virus), for what? I need to emphasize again, we are working risking our own lives for the safety of not only our friends and families but also everyone of you. Please keep in mind: tell each other: Stay at home, Do not get out, do not party, for the seek of lowering the chance of getting infected by this deadly virus. <br>\nAnother bad news I want to share is, the virus has mutated into its second generation, that means comparing with the first generation virus which could be in some degree dealt with, it became deadly dangerous, while first generation has an infection rate of 1 to 14, the second generation could be exponentially infectious. So keep in mind: Do NOt get out, Do not party, Do not share meals with each other! thank you all!<br>\n<br>\n#######<br>\nfuck真的好恐怖，這要翻譯成英文報料給國際媒體要求國際人道組織強制介入了，ccp真的準備棄城了，難怪醫護人員說上級都不管，根本沒有人在一線組織，領導們都跑了不管了，最多被罵然後發幾條通知新聞什麼的做做樣子，TMD武漢人民給這個罪惡的政權陪葬了!<br>\n各位轉到twitter上，多多引起國際關注","date":"2020-01-25","agreeCount":15,"discussionCount":0}
