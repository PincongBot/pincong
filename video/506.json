The truth wielded like a bloody truncheon, cracking skulls of the systemically oppressed.<br>\n<br>\n這城街巷，今天只有殘留的軀殼，揭穿了一個前人未曾想我們繼承的殘局。無人問：「為甚麼會變成這樣？」但答案，我們都了然於胸。月復月、日復日，每個衝擊點滴累積成集體壓抑 ──鐵血的制度不止壓下染血的警棍、被爆的頭顱，也壓下真相。<br>\n<br>\nI’ll tell you how I really feel. I’m scared. Scared to imagine a future where all my freedoms are taken away because I know what I’ve lost. And even so, that is nothing compared to imagining a future for a generation where they’ve no idea what freedom is. In fact, this is the present for many already, their birth right was stolen by weak men and women who deem independent thought and ideas too dangerous, and will go so far as to run tanks over any who break this narrative they desperately cling to.<br>\n<br>\n坦白說，我很怕。很怕去想像將來一旦敗陣終將失去的一切。但更怕去想，未來可能有一世代的人不知自由為何物。可能這已是今天很多人的現況。怯懦之人視獨立思考為至危之物，將下一代本來生而有之的權利與光明前路奪去，他們甚至用坦克輾碎堅持真相的人。<br>\n<br>\nBut I’ll tell you what. I’m not scared of them; when I see the youth of Hong Kong and those behind them rally fearlessly in what they believe in, spitting in the face of apathy and police brutality, we’ve an entire generation who will pave ahead a time where history doesn’t repeat itself - repeat the cruelty of our would-be masters.<br>\n<br>\n我跟你說，我不怕他們。當我看到香港的年輕人和背後千千萬萬個支持者挺身而出，他們的勇氣與智慧，在無情冷血的警暴之下依然不屈，我們整個世代會開創新的前路，超越時空，衝破歷史的永劫回歸，不再重複那可能主宰我們的殘酷。<br>\n<br>\nYou who continue this protest, know that you are incredible. Ignore the hate, reject the ignorance, take each step forward with pride - pride that we control our own future. We should be forever proud to be known as Hongkongers.<br>\n<br>\n在抗爭中的你，真了不起。無視仇恨，拒絕愚蒙，我們昂然邁進每步，因我們堅信終可重掌未來。我們應永遠為身為香港人而自豪。<br>\n<br>\nPlease share this song with everyone you know. Thank you for watching and listening.<br>\n<br>\nUntil then, be water. Be safe. Be Free.<br>\n<br>\nGlory to HONG KONG<br>\n<br>\n#香港 #香港人 #hongkong #nochinaextradition<br>\n#chinaextradition #noevillaw #extraditionlaw #china #hkpolice #反送中 #反逃犯條例  #五大訴求 #freedomhk #antielab #hkpolice #iwishk #standwithhk #FightForFreedom","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQGR-RvFONw","date":"2019-11-17","agreeCount":8,"discussionCount":1}
