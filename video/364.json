him.<br>\nBig shout out to SyeTen.<br>\n<br>\nI’ll share with you the tale of when<br>\nI met some baggy-trousered gentlemen<br>\nThey spoke with flair<br>\nand with panache<br>\nThey all had beards<br>\nbut no moustache<br>\n<br>\nThey had a book called the Qur'an<br>\ncontaining some divine and cosmic plan<br>\nAnd then I cringed<br>\nin fear and dread<br>\nas one closed up his book and said<br>\n<br>\nJust do it<br>\nJust do it<br>\nDo it before you die<br>\nJoin Islam, come on man<br>\nDon't upset the man in the sky<br>\nThe consequences are dire<br>\nYou'll really piss him off<br>\nand then he'll burn you in the fire<br>\nJust do it<br>\nJust do it now!<br>\n<br>\nSo I said:<br>\nI can't do it<br>\nI can't do it<br>\nI really don't believe in God<br>\nYour passion and your fashion<br>\nI really think are really rather odd<br>\n<br>\nNo derision<br>\nIt's my decision<br>\nand I don't like the<br>\nidea of a circumcision<br>\nI won’t do it<br>\nI won’t join Islam.<br>\n<br>\nJoin Islam<br>\nRead the Qur'an<br>\nLinguistically it’s sublime<br>\nI’ve checked and<br>\nIt’s perfect<br>\nIn every way and for all time<br>\nIt’s righteous<br>\nIt has no likeness<br>\nHere’s a verse with<br>\nforty-two rhetorical devices<br>\nJust do it<br>\nJoin Islam now!<br>\n<br>\nAnd I said:<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI’ve never felt the need to pray<br>\nOn a carpet<br>\nwith a view of men’s arses<br>\nI’m sorry I don’t pray that way<br>\nI’m at a disadvantage<br>\nI can’t read the language<br>\nAll I want is lager and a bacon sandwich<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI won’t join Islam<br>\n<br>\nAnd he said<br>\nI won’t boast<br>\nbut first and foremost<br>\nask yourself what if you’re wrong.<br>\nYou believe that something<br>\ncame from nothing?<br>\nMy faith could never be that strong!<br>\nIt’s not pragmatic<br>\nIt’s un-Quranic<br>\nIt violates the second<br>\nlaw of thermodynamics<br>\nThink about it<br>\nBut don't take too long<br>\n<br>\nAnd I said:<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nNot without some evidence<br>\nI’m not biassed<br>\nJust give me science<br>\nNone of you are making sense<br>\nIt’s not for me, man<br>\nLeave me be, man<br>\nI’d rather pour a glass<br>\nand drink my daddy’s semen<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI won’t join Islam<br>\n<br>\nAnd they said<br>\n&quot;Brother makes a good point&quot;<br>\nJoin islam<br>\nBut only if you feel inclined<br>\nOur obsession<br>\nis freedom of expression<br>\nJust say whatever’s on your mind<br>\n<br>\nIt’s splendid<br>\nWe commend it,<br>\nBut we reserve the right<br>\nto never be offended<br>\nJoin islam<br>\nJoin islam now<br>\n<br>\nAnd I said:<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI believe in equality<br>\nIt’s a given:<br>\nrights for women<br>\nhave no place in your ideology<br>\nNo integration<br>\nNo education<br>\nThe only thing your females<br>\nget is genital mutilation<br>\nThat’s final<br>\nI won’t join Islam<br>\n<br>\nAnd they said:<br>\nJoin Islam<br>\nJust do it<br>\nThe moment is so opportune<br>\nOur practice:<br>\nTo blacklist<br>\nevery novel and cartoon<br>\n<br>\nKeep silent<br>\nWe’re strident<br>\nWe’ll chop the head off<br>\nanyone who says we’re violent<br>\nJoin Islam<br>\nJust do it NOW!<br>\n<br>\nAnd I said:<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nCensorship I Despise<br>\nIt’s fair<br>\nto declare the<br>\nuniversal right to criticize<br>\n<br>\nI don’t want Sharia<br>\nround here<br>\nI’d rather pack my bags<br>\nand move to North Korea<br>\nI won’t do it<br>\nI won’t join Islam<br>\n<br>\nAnd they said:<br>\nJoin Islam<br>\nJust do it<br>\nWestern women are all whores<br>\nHere’s my sister<br>\nNo man has kissed her<br>\nJoin us and she’ll be all yours<br>\n<br>\nShe’s no shirker<br>\nA real hard worker<br>\nShe’ll show you everything<br>\nshe’s got beneath her burqa<br>\nJust do it!<br>\nJoin Islam now!<br>\n<br>\nAnd I said:<br>\nALRIGHT!!<br>\nI’ll do it<br>\nI’m a red-blooded male<br>\nIt’s intriguing<br>\nI’m pleading<br>\nto find out what’s behind her veil<br>\n<br>\nTo Allah<br>\nI give my shahada<br>\nI’m in a state of frenzy<br>\nand a lustful lather<br>\nI’ll do it!<br>\nI’ll do it now!<br>\n<br>\nI’ve done it<br>\nI’m ready<br>\nto bang her like a man possessed<br>\nI’m burning<br>\nI’m yearning<br>\nAs she slowly gets undressed<br>\nUh oh!<br>\nI stammer<br>\nI piss my pyjamas<br>\nCos she’s bog-eyed and her<br>\nface is like a bag of hammers<br>\nI can’t do it<br>\nI wanna leave Islam!<br>\n<br>\nAllahu akbar, It says here<br>\nTerms and conditions apply<br>\nOne small penalty<br>\nfor apostasy<br>\nLeave and you must die<br>\n<br>\nThere's no compulsion in religion<br>\nBut revoking your shahada<br>\ngets you crucifixion<br>\nYou've done it<br>\nYou've done it now!","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uQBgrUObbHw","date":"2019-10-13","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":4}
