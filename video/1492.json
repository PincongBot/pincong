Those in the media and the Democratic Party who think that the Chinese are going to be honest dealers in anything haven’t been watching for the last few decades or they’re on China’s payroll (like Hunter Biden). Perhaps both. This is why it’s so important for us to have our own manufacturing our own supply chains (like @realdonaldtrump and MAGA has always called for) and not be entirely dependent on bad dealers who have no interest in being good neighbors, but simply want world domination for themselves.<br>\nDon’t believe me? Just ask yourself why the Chinese government would not let the worlds foremost expert in infectious disease control from the CDC into their country to help just weeks ago. If you think they’re dealing in good faith you’re an imbecile. Also ask why the US media is running with China’s propaganda talking points. <br>\n<br>\n#wuhan #virus<br>\n<br>\n忍不住又重新放了一次這個個人一直很喜歡的影片 (*/ω＼*)","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4p8Aq5BM9io","date":"2020-03-15","agreeCount":12,"discussionCount":0}
