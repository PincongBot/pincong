With community spread rampant, she warned that the more than 4,000 new cases the county registered on Thursday “could lead to over 18,000 infected people in a few weeks.”<br>\n<br>\n“And this is just from one day of new cases,” Dr. Ferrer said. “Without aggressive action on the part of every person, we will not get back to slowing the spread.”<br>\n<br>\nMore than 75,600 cases were reported on Thursday, according to a New York Times database, the 11th time in the past month that the U.S. daily record was broken. The previous single-day record, 68,241 cases, was announced last Friday.","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JAyvGwCrt9s","date":"2020-07-18","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
